# Craigsboat
Jesse and Conway's Craigsboat Python Exercise

# Objectives
1. Learn Python and its useful packages!
1. Learn how to contribute to code projects with Git and GitHub
1. Create a database of boat listings and conduct some basic data science on them:
  1. Investigate how age, model, distance, etc. affects retail price
  2. See how prices change over time
  3. Predict prices based on a boat's characteristics

# Packages and Concepts to Use and Learn
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup4
- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Pandas

# Data Format
- For each boat listing, get a single dictionary with attribute names as the keys, and values as values. E.g. {'id':'55341', 'price':'$5500'...}
- Then get a list of all boat listing dictionaries: [{'id'...}, {'id'...}, {'id'...}]
