# Craigsboat
Jesse and Conway's Craigsboat Python Exercise

# [GitHub Page Link](https://conwayyao.github.io/Craigsboat/)

# Objectives
1. Learn Python and its useful packages!
1. Learn how to contribute to code projects with Git and GitHub
1. Create a database of boat listings and conduct some basic data science on them:
  1. Investigate how age, model, distance, etc. affects retail price
  2. See how prices change over time
  3. Predict prices based on a boat's characteristics

# Packages and Concepts to Use and Learn
- [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
- [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
- [Regular Expressions (Regex)](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)

# Data Format
- For each boat listing, get a single dictionary with attribute names as the keys, and values as values. E.g. {'id':'55341', 'price':'$5500'...}
- Then get a list of all boat listing dictionaries: [{'id'...}, {'id'...}, {'id'...}]

#Next Steps
Conway:
- figure out a way to automatically generate google map URLs with CSV files
- host webscraper on AWS
- schedule AWS run

Jesse:
- to post in Github or HTML, this is a learning exercise plz don't sue us Craigslist like you did to PadMapper
- implement Google Analytics
- Javascript --> select: Country, Locality according to Github CSV Files to spit out
- refine CSS a bit
