It has super low hours, about 210 hours! I have kicker speaker that glow up, aftermarket radio system, and a sub that can be included for the right price. I also have led lighting under the seats etc. This boat does have bed space, microwave, sink, stove, bathroom, ac and all that! Every winter I had it shrink wrapped and winterized. After the winter I had the boat detailed every year I have owned it. The previous owners had the boat on a lift its whole life they barely took it out. I then bought it and continued to keep it on a lift and then moved to school where they don't allow lifts. I now have the boat painted and detailed frequently. This season I replaced the steering wheel and switches and some other stuff to enhance the performance. This boat has a canvas option, the half cover, and the full cover. I always put the full cover on when I left. The boat is missing a rear seat back rest. I am a bit negotiable so call or text me and we will work it out show contact info",210,5880115793,30,Wellcraft,Martinique,$13000,power," (Washington, D.C.)",2000 wellcraft Martinique 2600,https://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/boa/5880115793.html,2000

48,new,2016-11-21 13:52,"I've built a couple of these CLC boats over the years (canoes and kayak) and overstretched when I bought this kit. I realize now that I won't really have a place to store it once completed and I no longer have the garage/workshop space to easily assemble the kit. This is a great opportunity to get this beautiful boat kit for a steep discount. I can help with local delivery as well - everything would fit in the back of my station wagon. I would also be more than willing to help you out with building the boat here and there or just offer advice - I love building these kits and would be fun to work on this one.  ***The pictures are examples of the completed boat, obviously not the kit I am selling. These are great boats - I rowed and sailed one of these down on a lake in Georgia. What you get: Skerry Base kit, Skerry Sprit Rig sailing kit, and a tanbark sail upgrade. I have included the link below to the CLC website that shows the full contents of each kit. Everything is there, including all the epoxy you need, etc. Interested buyers can come take a look and go down the list item by item to make sure everything is there and in excellent condition. Note: I built the sailing rig portion of the kit: so the rudder, dagger board, boom, mast, and sprit are all completed. This would save you a full week's worth of work on those items alone. The actual boat / base kit components are untouched. These items new from CLC cost $2719.00 ($2883 including tax). ( $1425 for the boat kit, $1149 for the sail kit, $145 for the tanbark (rust colored) sail) I am asking $2000 (that is over 30% discount from the original price).

It has tons of storage for gear, with two built-in areas for fishing lures and equipment, and fishing rod holders throughout.

Title in hand. Unlike most this one was upgraded to the OMC King Cobra ( 7.5L ) with OMC outdrive, that said she gets up and going much quicker. Shrinkwrapped by professionals at the end of every season and winterized. New canvas top was purchased Fall 2015. Air conditioning system will come with the boat but I have not had it installed, currently in one of the many storage compartments. Sleeps 6 or five adults. Check out the video on youtube below. Quick video at the Marina https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U76C837JQog The 2550 has always been a great starter boat due to the length of 25' (overall 27 with swim platform) and the width almost 10' which gives more space then any other boat of it's size. Will come with two batteries always on a charger (new Guest 2910) , I use the ship to shore power. I have the Ciera cruising the Potomac just about every other weekend and occasionally over on the Cheasepeake Bay.

The MacGregor 26X is a power sailer-- unlike most sailboats, you can drain the water ballast, kick up the 50 hp engine and take off at 15 mph.  Great for getting to and from sailing grounds, outrunning weather, or just get to where you're going. Also, the MacGregor 26X is about the biggest boat you can reasonably fit on a trailer, with plenty of room for living aboard-- enclosed head, two large double berths, a dinette, alcohol stove. Easy to trailer-- Weighs just 2,000 lbs empty. We have trailered this boat up and down the East Coast, including the Potomac, the Chesapeake, the Atlantic Ocean, the NY Finger Lakes.  Lived on it for weeks at a time in Key West, and sailed the 70 miles to the Dry Tortugas. Equipment: 50 hp Honda four-stroke engine - Regularly serviced - Carburetors replaced in 2013 CDI Roller Furler 150% furling genoa Bimini- Can be used while sailing, does not interfere with boom.  Folds out of way when not needed.

It has tons of storage for gear, with two built-in areas for fishing lures and equipment, and fishing rod holders throughout. This boat offers the best of all options - it is a wonderful, stable cruising pontoon, it has plenty of power to kneeboard and ski, and it is built for fishing, with storage and 4 bass seats at all four corners. - Humminbird depth finder and GPS unit with full B&W high-contrast LCD screen - New Boss AM/FM Stereo, with Bluetooth and full remote control.

Some new vinyl repairs were made earlier this year. The seats are otherwise solid. - The manual sink pump does not work, but the fresh water tank and sink drain are working fine.

Fishing hands-free on a kayak is a wonderful experience.  This boat will allow you to go where others cannot. I have the upgraded turbo fins, which produce massive amounts of speed and power when you want it.  You will blow away any kayak on the water, well unless they are in another Hobie.  The turbo fins are great when you want to get somewhere quickly.  This kayak is literally unaffected by wind due to its low profile and pedals powered drive system. When I say the fins produce power I mean it.  I dragged my wife and son on their kayaks at the same time for 6 miles in the Occoquan. The fins are perfectly designed so you can paddle in the shallows or in great depths. The kayak is great for over night trips, or just day trips.  There is plenty of room for storage and its pretty comfy. I have a homemade live-well if you want it.  Its basically a plastic container with a mr. bubbles air pump.

The Pearson Renegade is a 27' sloop rigged sailboat produced by Pearson Yachts of Bristol, RI from 1966-1969, with the first boats being sold in 1967. Designed by William Shaw, about 175 of the boats were built. They were Pearson's first split underbody boat and were designed to Cruising Club of America racing rules. They are also one of the first American ""racer-cruiser"" style boats that combine the comforts of a cruising boat with the advantage of a modified full keel with a spade rudder (see photo), like that of the Bill Lapworth Cal 40 designs that revolutionized ocean racing in the mid-late 1960s. The keel allows the boat to track well and have good stability. The deep balanced rudder allows a high degree of maneuverability, and the turning radius of the boat is very tight. They continue to be a sought after boat because of their stout construction and kindly sailing ability. Early versions had a traditional two settee salon, while boats produced in 1968 and after feature a more modern galley starboard and settee to port. Both have a spacious V-berth over six feet long and were available with either a 30-HP Universal Atomic 4 gas inboard or an outboard well. The cockpit can comfortably accommodate 4-6 people, and the boat can sleep 4 adults below decks.

Previously, the vessels were used mostly by hard-core hunters and navigators. Folbot founder Jakob Kissner of Germany took his idea of a folding-kayak business to London in 1931. Two years later, seeking to tap into the burgeoning U.S. market, he moved it to Long Island City, N.Y., and Folbot was born. the slogan was ""From bag to boat in 20 minutes."" With technology improvements, the smaller boats could be set up in nine minutes. This folbot has been in our family since the late 60's.  My Dad and I would paddle on Guntersville Lake and the Tennessee River in Alabama.  Later in the 80's he bought the sail package for it and the last time I went out with  my Dad was the summer of 1982 on Lake Henderson, North Carolina. We did have a chance to take my niece out on the Potomac River, Maryland in the 90's.  It has been carefully packed and stored since then.

It comes with an upgraded Ocean Kayak seat. Free delivery is available locally and for a nominal fee outside my area. This is the ultimate fishing machine in terms of paddle kayaks, it's best to research this kayak to know what you're buying (has a rod pod, fish finder sonar shield, transducer-ready scupper, etc). This is a very stable but fast kayak and tracks straight. It has a very generous 550 lbs weight capacity with lots of room to store almost anything on the deck or within the hull.

The only con of this kayak is that due to it's stability and high weight capacity, it does not make as sharp turns in the water as some smaller kayaks. Also, while this kayak can handle any body of water between neighborhood ponds/lakes to the ocean surf, this kayak would not be appropriate for white water use.

Not strictly classified as a racer but will beat nearly any daysailer in it's class. Cutter rig allows for some really nice windward performance. Easy to single-hand with cam cleats just behind the winches. Lots of storage room in the cabin and a place to get out of the rain. I was skeptical of the 2hp outboard when I bought it but am impressed how well it works especially since the boat's displacement is only 1200#. This also makes it easy to tow and load even for my Outback. Trailer has surface rust as is evident from the tire picture but tires are 2015 and hubs have been recently repacked and greased regularly. All the trailer lights are working.  Over a $1000 in replacements and upgrades in the last 2 seasons.  No leaks.  Keel well very solid.  Previous owner has stiffened hull to prevent oil canning.  This is a pretty strong and fast boat for it's length and displacement. Fall 2016: New rear trailer tail lights and safety chains. Spring 2016: Topside and deck repainted. All deck hardware rebedded with new backing plate where appropriate. All wood replaced with white oak and birch panel for companionway. Bottom sanded but left unpainted (better in my opinion for a trailer sailer). Swing keel faired with epoxy and painted. Very good shape. New brake winch and cable. Carburetor on outboard motor rebuilt. Runs great! Added guide bars on side of trailer to assist in loading. Fall 2015: Replaced rubber V-stop for bow and keel on trailer. Added boom vang and foresail pendants. Spring 2015: New tires. Added lights to pass Maryland inspection. New trailer winch. Built mini-deck in the cabin.  Washed sails. This boat heels really nicely.

It has the upgraded engine (Mercruiser 4.3L V6 190 HP), Alpha One outdrive, the sport seating option, a large bimini top, removal snap-in carpet, cockpit and bow covers, and fish finder with depth finder. It has been winterized every year and stored on the trailer. Engine oil, oil filter, fuel filter, zincs changed every spring. Outdrive oil changed every other year. A tune up with new plugs, wires, cap & rotor was done in the spring, along with a new battery. There is no hour meter, but we have used it as a weekend boat and we have docked it on either fresh or brackish rivers, while the previous owner kept it on a lake. The hull and outdrive are bottom painted. The boat is always covered between uses and the interior cleaned/conditioned to keep it in good shape. The boat will be in the water until early November, so sea trials are an option for serious buyers. This is an excellent boat with options, for the family or for entertaining friends.

It uses two aluminum step ladders for outriggers. (Unique design) Points great. It comes with brand new Sunfish sail never used:  (white racing sale). It has Sunfish boom and masts all in good working order. There is a leeboard and rudder.  The main hull was modeled somewhat from Toronado cat hull. It is painted with Interlux Perfection 2 part paint. Stored in garage.  Little outrigger hull is made of paulownia wood. The whole boat fully rigged weighs less than 250lbs. You could lay down inside the hull. If you wanted you could add a larger sail or even put a motor on it. You could take 4-5 people on it. This boat is truly cool and really attracts a lot of attention. Easy to sail solo.  You can paddle it sitting down on your cooler that you put inside the hull. You have to see this craft. Paddle out. Put up the sail and away you go! It comes with steel trailer with all new wiring and lights, bearings have been repacked. I have title to trailer but not the boat. I could give you bill of sail for boat. I'd keep it, but a new job won't allow me to sail it much. I've been out on the Chesapeake Bay with it. Very easy to rig and sail. From trailer to water is 15 minutes. You just attach the outriggers (ladders) with 4 bolts each, attach the little boat with rope, and you're done. Great for lakes, bays.

As one can see this rules out most men although they are out there and we're hopeful they apply!

Now, to drive sales/revs, we've begun a concentrated focus on closing partnerships with lux travel advisors and their respective networks - first in NYC, Boston, Metro D.C. and Chicago markets. Meetings are underway and the successful candidate will be attending and prospecting along with the CEO weekly. This position will be 2nd in command of company. Essentially, job description encompasses recruiting and overseeing V.P.-level exec. folks who then lead their respective operational teams while also working closely with CEO on strategic and finance projects to drive growth. And, of course, sailing upon all oceans. Start next week with meetings in NYC, then first part of November sail, with Captain/CEO Craig, our temp. office to Key West down the spectacular ICW.

377,excellent,2016-11-17 11:00,"Harmony is in great condition, restored at one point by a previous owner. It is obvious she has been loved over the years. I am currently a live-aboard on her. I am sad to have to part with her, I am military and she is over my weight limit to move to my next duty station. She runs on a Perkins 4108 engine which starts up easily. She has plenty of room with a large, super comfortable V berth and aft berth. Over all she is 33 feet long, almost a 13 foot beam and 4 foot draft. Perks: Functioning AC/Heating unit that kept up with this summers heat.(3Yrs) Water filtration system. New hot water heater.(SEP16) (Kumo, stainless steel...almost impossible to replace the old one). She was recently painted 4 months ago, bottom looks great. She comes with everything needed for sailing, GPS's and coast guard requirements. Solid foundation. Thick fiberglass hull, over built and made for a beating. She is set up as a live aboard, with fridge, microwave, toaster oven. She has updated hydraulic steering(5Yrs). Working Head and Shower. ****Survey done in JAN 2016, results in hand**** Comes with countless extras. Magnum Propane Grill, Bimini. Short Comings: She is missing a stove, I made up for it with appliances. Can discuss installing stove or giving stove before buy. The hours on the engine are questionable, but I keep up with maintenance and she has never had an issue and runs great. The sails have seen some use, they should be good for a few more years if she isn't ran hard. Over all she is a simple boat with simple systems. She is probably one of the least temperamental boats I have seen.

403,excellent,2016-11-16 17:41,"SeaRay 290 Sundancer (1994 express cruiser).  Owned the boat for 3 years.  We sold our 25 foot Bayliner express cruiser to get into a bigger boat.  So after 3 years, we want to move up again.  We have already found our next boat at 43 feet.  I have never bought a new boat so I know what it is like buying used (reading one thing and driving out and seeing something else).    The pictures are real and it's a lot of boat for the price I am asking.  The buyer is getting the better deal! As a mechanic and craftsman, I have replaced all the vinyl covered plywood cushioned sides of the cockpit with ¼ inch white ""Starboard"" custom cut panels bordered with ""Plastique"" trim.  Easy to clean and invincible to water.  I opened up the back cockpit for easier access to engine panels (original design was too cluttered with un-needed seating).  All the canvas you see in the pictures are all in good shape and functional (new side isinglass window panels).  Entire cooling system of the motor is new (intake manifold, thermostat housing, exhaust manifolds, risers, raw water pump).  All new bellows and gimbal bearing.  New remanufactured lower unit.  Engine is clean and being a single 454 Mercruiser with Bravo II outdrive, the engine compartment is awesome for easy access to both sides of the motor.  I Fresh water flush after every use.  Raymarine A65 GPS chart plotter with a digital sounder module.  VHF radio.  New Boss MR752UAB stereo system (Bluetooth, marinized, MP3-compatible CD AM/FM receiver).  New dual trumpet horn.  New shore power plug.  New Bennet trim tab servos. New engine vent covers (2 per side).  Barely used Load Rite triple axle trailer.

At 26 ft., it is a great size for a full day on the water with plenty of room for everyone. Equipped with a 7.4L big block MerCrusier and Bravo 1 outdrive, full cover, bimini, and camper top, and currently has around 550 hours on it. I purchased the boat from the original owner, who had bought and stored the boat indoors its whole life at Time 'n Tyde Marina in Woodbridge. Since taking ownership, the boat has been kept at Pilot House Marina. Bottom paint was last done 2 years ago as we were keeping it in a wet slip. The past two seasons we opted for the covered lift slip to avoid doing the bottom paint again. Last winter a drive service was done, as well as new starter, gimbal bearing and bellows. All work was performed at Potomac Marine - I can provide any interested buyer with a contact at the shop who is very familiar with the boat. This past season we had absolutely no issues, with approximately 20 outings. All photos below are from various trips this season. Each time we went out the boat started right up, and runs strong. There are a few minor things that need some work - the radio is not hooked up. The 4 original speakers are still in place and likely still work, but the headunit will need to be replaced. The boat has a fresh water system with a small tank in the stern, but the pump does not kick on when the switch is flipped. We never used it anyway so it wasn't a concern. Lastly, the carpeting on the inside of the gunwales needs to be glued back up or replaced. Boat is still in its slip, and a test ride could be arranged. I do not have a trailer for it, so any transportation needs to be arranged by the buyer. Please feel free to call or text with any other questions.

I am sad to have to part with her, I am military and she is over my weight limit to move to my next duty station. She runs on a Perkins 4108 engine which starts up easily. She has plenty of room with a large, super comfortable V berth and aft berth. Over all she is 33 feet long, almost a 13 foot beam and 4 foot draft. Perks: Functioning AC/Heating unit that kept up with this summers heat.(3Yrs) Water filtration system. New hot water heater.(SEP16) (Kumo, stainless steel...almost impossible to replace the old one). She was recently painted 4 months ago, bottom looks great. She comes with everything needed for sailing, GPS's and coast guard requirements. Solid foundation. Thick fiberglass hull, over built and made for a beating. She is set up as a live aboard, with fridge, microwave, toaster oven. She has updated hydraulic steering(5Yrs). Working Head and Shower. ****Survey done in JAN 2016, results in hand**** Comes with countless extras. Magnum Propane Grill, Bimini. Short Comings: She is missing a stove, I made up for it with appliances. Can discuss installing stove or giving stove before buy. The hours on the engine are questionable, but I keep up with maintenance and she has never had an issue and runs great. The sails have seen some use, they should be good for a few more years if she isn't ran hard. Over all she is a simple boat with simple systems.

491,,2016-11-14 16:58,I have a 1997 Sea-Doo SPX for sale. I bought the jet ski Back In Summer from a friend who needed it gone and needed the money. It was serviced by Pete's Cycle last year and never ran after. When I arrived to pick it up the battery was dead and we use a jump box to try to start it. We did not hook up the hose but I just wanted to hear the engine crank over. It cranks over fine sounds healthy and the engine bay is pretty clean. I haven't really tried to fool around with it so I'm not sure that it runs as it sits. It may need fresh gas to run. It's registration is good through the end of the year and it comes with the trailer. It needs a good cleaning as it's been sitting outside under a tarp but I would imagine it will clean up nice. I do not know if the engine has been rebuilt but it is very clean under the seat unlike other 2 stroke jet ski that I have messed around with.  I honestly don't really want to sell it  but I'm in the process of buying a house so it has to go. Looking to get $600 or best offer. I am actually losing money but I feel bad about the title situation. The trailer has no title but it looks fairly new and it needs a tail light. CLEAN TITLE.
