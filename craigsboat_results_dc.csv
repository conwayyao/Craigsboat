The Kokatat Hydrus 3L SuperNova Angler Paddling Suit begs the question, ""Why wear waders when you can wear a full suit that will keep you dry and safe in the event of a swim?"" Based on the popular Kokatat SuperNova, the Kokatat Hydrus SuperNova Angler Paddling Suit is constructed of Kokatat Hydrus fabric for increased durability. Cordura¬Æ reinforcements on the seat, elbows and the entire front legs keep the suit protected from fishing tackle and other sharp objects. The relief zipper is covered so you can keep the scales on your catch and not your crotch! A comfortable APT (punch through) neoprene neck gasket keeps you dry in the event of a swim, while latex wrist gaskets make a watertight seal above the hand. Integrated socks are covered with an adjustable gravel guard. Integrated socks are a premium feature for drysuits, and make them a lot simpler and more comfortable. This suit can be used by a man our woman and is in almost new condition. I bought it for kayaking, and it is awesome as a safety barrier in the event of an unexpected swim. It is made for fishing, and I'm sure it is great for that too! The suit is a medium: for size chart, check out: https://shop.clavey.com/kokatat-hydrus-3l-supernova-angler-paddling-suit-p430.aspx I am quite a bit smaller then the suit is designed for, but it has a waist cinch that lets you keep the pants at your hips, and once you put a PFD on, it compresses the extra fabric. This suit is a semi-dry suit, the only different between that and a dry-suit is that the neck is made out of neoprene instead of latex. This means it is a lot more comfortable and less constricting in the neck. If you  are planning to do a lot of rolling and deliberately submerging yourself, this is not the right suit for you. But if you are looking for something to keep you warm and dry when you are out paddling or fishing, and safe if you to take an accidental swim, then it is perfect!! I have used it and tested in, and for just jumping in the water it is great and will keep you dry. I am selling it only because I had to switch to a full drysuit once I started rolling and staying fully submerged upside down for a while. . . As with all drysuits, your under layers control how warm you stay, but it is really convenient to know that even without a swim, you can stay dry and warm even if it pours rain or you are splashing around a bit.",,5905447000,39.246180,10,-77.798696,Kokatat,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@39.246180,-77.798696,16z",Hydrus 3L SuperNova Angler Paddl,$400,human, (Harpers Ferry),Kokatat Drysuit for paddling or fishing,https://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/boa/5905447000.html,

The boat has a 33 gallon tank, the big Yamaha water separator filter,  dual batteries, Garmin sounder, operating on a transom transducer and a Garmin 492 GPS map and sounder, which operates on a thru hull transducer. Oil changed every year, there are less than 300 hours on the motor. It is a dry boat, currently in the water. I installed a new transom six years ago as well, and reshaped the cockpit.
