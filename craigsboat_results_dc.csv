5,excellent,11/25/16 17:51,"Yes, it's still for sale-- I will take the posting down the moment it's sold. . The MacGregor 26X is a power sailer-- unlike most sailboats, you can drain the water ballast, kick up the 50 hp engine and take off at 15 mph.  Great for getting to and from sailing grounds, outrunning weather, or just get to where you're going. Also, the MacGregor 26X is about the biggest boat you can reasonably fit on a trailer, with plenty of room for living aboard-- enclosed head, two large double berths, a dinette, alcohol stove. Easy to trailer-- Weighs just 2,000 lbs empty. We have trailered this boat up and down the East Coast, including the Potomac, the Chesapeake, the Atlantic Ocean, the NY Finger Lakes.  Lived on it for weeks at a time in Key West, and sailed the 70 miles to the Dry Tortugas. Equipment: 50 hp Honda four-stroke engine - Regularly serviced - Carburetors replaced in 2013 CDI Roller Furler 150% furling genoa Bimini- Can be used while sailing, does not interfere with boom.  Folds out of way when not needed. Opening ports in cabin Solar powered vent in forward hatch Enclosed head - Ventilation - Porta-potti (tall version) for easy - Sink in head, with working water (hand pump) Galley - Alcohol stove - Sink with water (hand pump) Electrical - Shore power - Two Batteries: Starting and Deep Cycle House Battery Trailer- MacGregor Notes:  All photos are actual photos of this particular boat-- no ""stock"" or ""sister boat"" photos. Location:  The boat and trailer are on land, available for inspection in the Crystal City area, very close to the Pentagon City Mall.

Each slip has its own electric meter and bill is usually around $30 per month depending on usage. Free use of the club house Floating dock on the beautiful Occoquan River 30 amp power but no water in the winter. Free pump-out station Free Wi-Fi Cable TV at the club house FYC offers many resort features including a beautifully landscaped clubhouse, picnic stations, playground, bath houses, private secure parking, new floating docks and a pump out station. For peace of mind, Fairfax Yacht Club has limited access through a secured key-card entry system. Much of the popularity of Fairfax Yacht Club can be attributed to its unique location on the scenic Occoquan River at the end of a no-wake zone. Unlike many commercial marinas further up the Occoquan, FYC is located along the Fairfax County shore very near the Mason Neck Wildlife Refuge, also allowing for quick access to enter Belmont Bay and the Potomac. No other location offers boaters a greater variety of popular cruising ports within easy reach. Georgetown, Washington D.C., Old Town Alexandria, The Town of Occoquan, the Chesapeake Bay, and many popular restaurants and swimming areas are within easy reach.

It has super low hours, about 210 hours! I have kicker speaker that glow up, aftermarket radio system, and a sub that can be included for the right price. I also have led lighting under the seats etc. This boat does have bed space, microwave, sink, stove, bathroom, ac and all that! Every winter I had it shrink wrapped and winterized. After the winter I had the boat detailed every year I have owned it. The previous owners had the boat on a lift its whole life they barely took it out. I then bought it and continued to keep it on a lift and then moved to school where they don't allow lifts. I now have the boat painted and detailed frequently. This season I replaced the steering wheel and switches and some other stuff to enhance the performance. This boat has a canvas option, the half cover, and the full cover.

The fiberglass hull is rated for up to 3 riders or 490lbs. The boat is equipped with an inboard 650cc 2-stroke engine (gas must be premixed 50:1), with approximately 55hp. I installed a newer engine from a 1994 TS 650 (documented on title). The engine has a larger carburetor with built in fuel pump. The jet mate is great for shallow water and is a stable fishing platform. I used it on the upper Potomac river and in creeks feeding the river.  The joystick controls make this boat easy to operate very maneuverable. Has forward, neutral and reverse. The jet pump is in good shape and has a Solas performance impeller. Great acceleration with no cavitation. Breaks plane easily with 3 people. I've also pulled tubes! The top speed is 30mph (using a gps). If that's not fast enough, this boat has huge modification potential. Kawasaki 750cc and 800cc engines will bolt right in with no custom modifications needed! Replacement engine, electrical, and jet pump components are readily available (Same engine as TS650, 650SX, SC650). New parts: - Stator - CDI/igniter - Freshly rebuilt  38mm Keihin carburetor CDKII (Upgraded from the stock 28mm carb) - Water witch bilge pump switch model 101. - Rear seat cover Note: The hull has some scrapes and small patches on the the underside. Could easy be cleaned up. Plastic intake grate needs to be replaced (picture #19). $40 part online. The trailer is basically two trailers made into one, or so i was told from the previous owner. The title says it was manufactured in 1989. Heavy duty frame and axles compared to most small boat/jetski trailers. Tires are in good shape. Wheel bearings have a bit of play in them (new bearings $30). The Jetmate is very easy to load and unload with this trailer. I have titles for the boat and trailer. The titles are in my name and ready to be signed over to you for the right price. Hate to sell, but don't have enough garage space to store it anymore. Time for someone else to enjoy.

The only con of this kayak is that due to it's stability and high weight capacity, it does not make as sharp turns in the water as some smaller kayaks.

161,salvage,11/23/16 12:55,"This sailboat has quite a bit of history attached to it involving the Atlantic Racing circuit and has sailed across the Atlantic and back.  She raced under the name of Fromstock Filius.  It has currently been dry-docked since April 2010.  It was a project at the time and some work has been completed but the project was abandoned some time after that. Little is known about the Deisel propulsion system in the boat.  It is a YanMar engine with 311 hours showing on the engine counter.  We cannot find engine model or serial number.  It is believed to have been running at the time of haul out.  No service history is available.  There is a lot of corrosion on the engine and accessories.  Interior needs a full restoration as it has been basically gutted out. Sails, some floorboards, and some hatch covers are available, most were re-finished.  Sails have been stored separately in dry storage, they were stored in sail sacks.  We have not checked the condition of the sails.  Most rigging appears to be in good shape.

Great Bob Finch design, fast and responsive (So far, her top surfing speed in the bay is 8.7 kts), sails very well to weather, she will point within 10 degrees to the wind and still move upwind well.  Predictable and controllable weather helm allows for some exciting sailing.  Classic, distinctive lines separate this boat from 'just another Hunter or Catalina 30'  This is the final year that this boat was built in California, the following year the production was moved to Costa Rica, opinions vary as to the effect this had on build quality. Sleeps 4-6 in two double and two single bunks. V forward, two singles in main cabin and double bunk under starboard cockpit. Cockpit sleeps two as well if you like sleeping under the stars for a cozy total of 8 if your all really good friends. Fold out table in main cabin, port and starboard bunks provide seating for 4. This is a well cared for boat, needs minor work to go sailing. We have sailed her almost everywhere on the Chesapeake Bay.

FYC offers many resort features including a beautifully landscaped clubhouse, picnic stations, playground, bath houses, private secure parking, new floating docks and a pump out station. For peace of mind, Fairfax Yacht Club has limited access through a secured key-card entry system. Much of the popularity of Fairfax Yacht Club can be attributed to its unique location on the scenic Occoquan River at the end of a no-wake zone. Unlike many commercial marinas further up the Occoquan, FYC is located along the Fairfax County shore very near the Mason Neck Wildlife Refuge, also allowing for quick access to enter Belmont Bay and the Potomac. No other location offers boaters a greater variety of popular cruising ports within easy reach. Georgetown, Washington D.C., Old Town Alexandria, The Town of Occoquan, the Chesapeake Bay, and many popular restaurants and swimming areas are within easy reach.

I realize now that I won't really have a place to store it once completed and I no longer have the garage/workshop space to easily assemble the kit. This is a great opportunity to get this beautiful boat kit for a steep discount. I can help with local delivery as well - everything would fit in the back of my station wagon. I would also be more than willing to help you out with building the boat here and there or just offer advice - I love building these kits and would be fun to work on this one.  ***The pictures are examples of the completed boat, obviously not the kit I am selling. These are great boats - I rowed and sailed one of these down on a lake in Georgia. What you get: Skerry Base kit, Skerry Sprit Rig sailing kit, and a tanbark sail upgrade. I have included the link below to the CLC website that shows the full contents of each kit. Everything is there, including all the epoxy you need, etc. Interested buyers can come take a look and go down the list item by item to make sure everything is there and in excellent condition. Note: I built the sailing rig portion of the kit: so the rudder, dagger board, boom, mast, and sprit are all completed. This would save you a full week's worth of work on those items alone. The actual boat / base kit components are untouched. These items new from CLC cost $2719.00 ($2883 including tax).

I have recently had two people make firm offers on the boat, and when it came time to complete the deal, they instead offered part cash and part motorcycle or RV.  I am not interested in exchanging items - this is a cash sale, please.   Thank you! This is a 2002 25' Crest Family Fish pontoon boat that seats 17, with a well-maintained 2002 90HP Honda Four Stroke engine. Plenty of power!

It has tons of storage for gear, with two built-in areas for fishing lures and equipment, and fishing rod holders throughout. This boat offers the best of all options - it is a wonderful, stable cruising pontoon, it has plenty of power to kneeboard and ski, and it is built for fishing, with storage and 4 bass seats at all four corners. - Humminbird depth finder and GPS unit with full B&W high-contrast LCD screen - New Boss AM/FM Stereo, with Bluetooth and full remote control.

Fishing hands-free on a kayak is a wonderful experience.  This boat will allow you to go where others cannot. I have the upgraded turbo fins, which produce massive amounts of speed and power when you want it.  You will blow away any kayak on the water, well unless they are in another Hobie.  The turbo fins are great when you want to get somewhere quickly.  This kayak is literally unaffected by wind due to its low profile and pedals powered drive system. When I say the fins produce power I mean it.  I dragged my wife and son on their kayaks at the same time for 6 miles in the Occoquan. The fins are perfectly designed so you can paddle in the shallows or in great depths. The kayak is great for over night trips, or just day trips.  There is plenty of room for storage and its pretty comfy. I have a homemade live-well if you want it.  Its basically a plastic container with a mr. bubbles air pump.

The Pearson Renegade is a 27' sloop rigged sailboat produced by Pearson Yachts of Bristol, RI from 1966-1969, with the first boats being sold in 1967. Designed by William Shaw, about 175 of the boats were built. They were Pearson's first split underbody boat and were designed to Cruising Club of America racing rules. They are also one of the first American ""racer-cruiser"" style boats that combine the comforts of a cruising boat with the advantage of a modified full keel with a spade rudder (see photo), like that of the Bill Lapworth Cal 40 designs that revolutionized ocean racing in the mid-late 1960s. The keel allows the boat to track well and have good stability. The deep balanced rudder allows a high degree of maneuverability, and the turning radius of the boat is very tight. They continue to be a sought after boat because of their stout construction and kindly sailing ability. Early versions had a traditional two settee salon, while boats produced in 1968 and after feature a more modern galley starboard and settee to port. Both have a spacious V-berth over six feet long and were available with either a 30-HP Universal Atomic 4 gas inboard or an outboard well. The cockpit can comfortably accommodate 4-6 people, and the boat can sleep 4 adults below decks.

293,good,11/21/16 10:39,"Portable, collapsible kayaks got their start in 1902, when German inventor Hans Klepper introduced them to the public. Previously, the vessels were used mostly by hard-core hunters and navigators. Folbot founder Jakob Kissner of Germany took his idea of a folding-kayak business to London in 1931. Two years later, seeking to tap into the burgeoning U.S. market, he moved it to Long Island City, N.Y., and Folbot was born. the slogan was ""From bag to boat in 20 minutes."" With technology improvements, the smaller boats could be set up in nine minutes. This folbot has been in our family since the late 60's.  My Dad and I would paddle on Guntersville Lake and the Tennessee River in Alabama.  Later in the 80's he bought the sail package for it and the last time I went out with  my Dad was the summer of 1982 on Lake Henderson, North Carolina. We did have a chance to take my niece out on the Potomac River, Maryland in the 90's.  It has been carefully packed and stored since then.

I AM A VERY MOTIVATED SELLER, any reasonable offers will be considered. Currently the boat did not start, I had a new starter put in and it started up. However, it does need an oil change drastically. I put in new batteries. I need this gone out of my driveway!

They told me all the belts and what not look great and I should be ready to go once the new fuel tank was in, I didn't have time to take it out that year or last season. The seats on the boat work well, but the upholstery is torn. We have redone the cushions in the cuddy cabin. In the cuddy is a port-a-pot which we have never used. Behind the captains seat is a sink which we have never used. The boat rides VERY nice. A lot of fun for cruising and tubing. I have been cruising at 45mph without any problems.

Not strictly classified as a racer but will beat nearly any daysailer in it's class. Cutter rig allows for some really nice windward performance. Easy to single-hand with cam cleats just behind the winches. Lots of storage room in the cabin and a place to get out of the rain. I was skeptical of the 2hp outboard when I bought it but am impressed how well it works especially since the boat's displacement is only 1200#. This also makes it easy to tow and load even for my Outback. Trailer has surface rust as is evident from the tire picture but tires are 2015 and hubs have been recently repacked and greased regularly. All the trailer lights are working.  Over a $1000 in replacements and upgrades in the last 2 seasons.  No leaks.  Keel well very solid.  Previous owner has stiffened hull to prevent oil canning.  This is a pretty strong and fast boat for it's length and displacement. Fall 2016: New rear trailer tail lights and safety chains. Spring 2016: Topside and deck repainted. All deck hardware rebedded with new backing plate where appropriate. All wood replaced with white oak and birch panel for companionway. Bottom sanded but left unpainted (better in my opinion for a trailer sailer). Swing keel faired with epoxy and painted. Very good shape. New brake winch and cable. Carburetor on outboard motor rebuilt. Runs great! Added guide bars on side of trailer to assist in loading. Fall 2015: Replaced rubber V-stop for bow and keel on trailer. Added boom vang and foresail pendants. Spring 2015: New tires. Added lights to pass Maryland inspection. New trailer winch. Built mini-deck in the cabin.  Washed sails. This boat heels really nicely.

It uses two aluminum step ladders for outriggers. (Unique design) Points great. It comes with brand new Sunfish sail never used:  (white racing sale). It has Sunfish boom and masts all in good working order. There is a leeboard and rudder.  The main hull was modeled somewhat from Toronado cat hull. It is painted with Interlux Perfection 2 part paint. Stored in garage.  Little outrigger hull is made of paulownia wood. The whole boat fully rigged weighs less than 250lbs. You could lay down inside the hull. If you wanted you could add a larger sail or even put a motor on it. You could take 4-5 people on it. This boat is truly cool and really attracts a lot of attention. Easy to sail solo.  You can paddle it sitting down on your cooler that you put inside the hull. You have to see this craft. Paddle out. Put up the sail and away you go! It comes with steel trailer with all new wiring and lights, bearings have been repacked. I have title to trailer but not the boat. I could give you bill of sail for boat. I'd keep it, but a new job won't allow me to sail it much. I've been out on the Chesapeake Bay with it. Very easy to rig and sail. From trailer to water is 15 minutes. You just attach the outriggers (ladders) with 4 bolts each, attach the little boat with rope, and you're done. Great for lakes, bays.

Along with other boats in the fleet, we'll be using a new 5/6 cabin, 50+ ft. catamaran for scheduled service, Saturday afternoon departures with guests from Key West, then an overnight sail to Havana, arriving just after sunrise for 1 or 2 weeks of cruising Cuba, with return to Key West for next client trip on Thursday afternoons/Friday arrival in Key West. Clients may opt for an extra day touring Cuba by flying back from Havana rather than sailing back upwind if desired. We have a highly-experienced Cuba tour travel partner that has expedited travel to Cuba for 13+ years - and now that it has become simple and legal for Americans to travel there, we're beginning this November with our regular sailing/cruising schedule. Our Cuba partner organizes and leads shore-based adventures with established people-to-people relationships throughout the island as guests' interests dictate. We'll be adding content at the product launch website below from upcoming Nov/Dec trips and then expand aggressively a comprehensive content marketing strategy/plan from there. This week we launch our group travel sales effort with a large travel planner network to begin selling/booking travel.

Our Cuba partner organizes and leads shore-based adventures with established people-to-people relationships throughout the island as guests' interests dictate. Preference given to a finance executive with a few specific skill sets, personality traits, financial technical acumen, cultural sophistication, listening ability & sales ability (one and the same basically), established professional network, personal ambition, intuition and drive - coupled with raw, dominant physical, mental and emotional ability to persevere. As one can see this rules out most men although they are out there and we're hopeful they apply! We are building a company from scratch - well almost (lots of assets in place already), i.e., you get to play an entrepreneur in real life and own some founding equity. Can't afford to fail? Lots of boring, safe accounting jobs out there for you. Want to help open, develop and own a piece of a massive new adventure travel industry opportunity? Join us in launching our luxury yacht charter vacations in Cuba and beyond, with our initial strategic differentiation built around active travel verticals (sailing, surfing, kite-boarding, diving, mountain biking, etc.) and targeting a fast-growing, high-income Millennial/Gen X market. Now, to drive sales/revs, we've begun a concentrated focus on closing partnerships with lux travel advisors and their respective networks - first in NYC, Boston, Metro D.C. and Chicago markets. Meetings are underway and the successful candidate will be attending and prospecting along with the CEO weekly. This position will be 2nd in command of company. Essentially, job description encompasses recruiting and overseeing V.P.-level exec. folks who then lead their respective operational teams while also working closely with CEO on strategic and finance projects to drive growth. And, of course, sailing upon all oceans. Start next week with meetings in NYC, then first part of November sail, with Captain/CEO Craig, our temp. office to Key West down the spectacular ICW. Please visit www.oceansciencesailing.com for a contact page to express interest in this position and thanks in advance for your consideration. We are on the ocean and underway daily so if you've got a track record of success and a passion to experience the last great cultural adventure left in the Caribbean you've landed at the right place. And if the timing or fit is not quite right, feel free to send this post along to a friend and you'll probably at least then end up in Havana this winter on vacation!
