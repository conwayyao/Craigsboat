81,,10/26/16 19:27,"I am selling my 1996 Kawasaki 1100ZXI. In complete honestly I never have had any mechanical issues with this jet ski. It's amazing how reliable they made these jetskis back then! A real blast to drive - it isnt as big/heavy as new jet skis so it turns very well and jumps waves like a champ. Top speed on this ski is around 60mph. Being that it is a 20yr old jet ski there are some cosmetic flaws. There was slight damage to the front nose of the jetski which was fixed. This does not change the way it drives at all. Also, there is fading in the leather and graphics. The deal is $2200 including the trailer as well as free docking on my jet-ski ramp until the end of the season if you decide you would like to. If you already have a trailer i am willing to reduce the price to $2000. The specs of the jet-ski are below: Length: 9' Weight: 564lbs Power: 120HP Hull: Sheet Molded Compound Feel free to stop by and look at it and possibly take it for a test drive.
