Speedometer does not work (factory type and may just be a tubing leak) but GPSed at 60+. Rock solid on the water. This is a package that was built by Tracker for Nitro. I will consider selling just the boat and trailer without the motor for $5,200.00 if you've got your own power. Boat is rated for up to 175 HP. The boat: 2000 Nitro by Tracker. Very well kept. All new seats. (plus 2 used spare seats. One with back and no post. One with no back and a tall post) Loads of storage compartments. New Humminbird 197c fishfinder at console and factory Tracker Pro 128 at the bow. Motor Guide Tracker 60, 12/24 volt trolling motor. On board 2 bank battery charger. Two bilge pumps. One factory and one new automatic.  Two live well pumps. One is new.  Detailed wiring. Three location trim controls. New dual steering cables. Well accented dash with water temp, fuel, volts, trim, water pressure, tack, speedo,  40 gallon gas tank and large oil tank for oil injection. Good on gas too. Current registration and clear title for boat. The motor: Mercury XR6 150 HP. Stainless steel prop. Recent maintenance included new plugs, impeller and lower unit lube. Starts easy and runs smooth. The Trailer: Two new wheels and tires. (700 miles) Two spares. Surge disc brakes. New breakaway safety cable. Bearing buddies with covers. Swing away tongue. Detailed wiring. New heavy duty transom saver. ""UPDATE"" - Clear title now in my name. I went way over budget when purchasing this package and doing upgrades this Summer to take to Canada but just can't afford to keep it. I'm only a bit negotiable when looking at cash because the season is still strong.

75,good,2016-11-10 01:54,"With some melancholy feelings attached, I have reluctantly decided to sell my Pumpkin Seed sailboat... a racing scow. I have owned her for 3 years but have never put her in the water. She needs a little bit of restorative work on the hull... namely, some wood repairs around the aft end of the lee board carriers and she really deserves to have the old school clear fiberglass coating over the entire hull stripped and redone due to crazing in the surface. She will look like a Boulevard boat when finished. Handbuilt of cedar strip and steam bent marine plywood in 1966 and garage stored for 40 years without sailing her by the previous owner. She comes with two sets of sails.. heavy and light air. She also comes with an extra set of spars including a mast and boom.  LOW 14.5 ft. Beam 5 ft. This sailboat has a pair of lee boards that slide through the hull protruding downward and slightly outward on each side. They pivot for adjustment as well as to bring them up into the hull. So there is no keel, dagger board or centerboard. Trailer shown under her was temporary and now gone. Have another sailboat trailer with mast cribbing built in but needs some hull cribbing modification to accommodate this boat for travelling that wouldn't damage the hull. I can probably do this if someone really wants the trailer along with the boat. I am asking $1600 for the sailboat and all accoutrement. The trailer can be had for $150 but I don't have any registration title for it. Never did. Sold to me in NJ with no title. #sailboat #woodenboat #vintageboat #woodensailboat Six, one, zero   3, four, nine   5, 1, zero, nine will get you more answers.",,5828850527,15,,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@40.576619,-75.526598,16z",Pumpkin Seed,$1600,sail, (Allentown),Sailboat/Handbuilt/Pumpkin Seed/ Racing Scow,https://scranton.craigslist.org/boa/5828850527.html,1966

She comes with two sets of sails.. heavy and light air. She also comes with an extra set of spars including a mast and boom.  LOW 14.5 ft. Beam 5 ft. This sailboat has a pair of lee boards that slide through the hull protruding downward and slightly outward on each side. They pivot for adjustment as well as to bring them up into the hull. So there is no keel, dagger board or centerboard. Trailer shown under her was temporary and now gone. Have another sailboat trailer with mast cribbing built in but needs some hull cribbing modification to accommodate this boat for travelling that wouldn't damage the hull. I can probably do this if someone really wants the trailer along with the boat. I am asking $1600 for the sailboat and all accoutrement. The trailer can be had for $150 but I don't have any registration title for it. Never did.
