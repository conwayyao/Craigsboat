It is not the best looking boat, but it is solid.  The clear coat is peeling off (see pictures) of the top cap, but rest of fiberglass looks good, just needs a good buffing.  I installed new carpet and expanded the front fishing deck (filled in center seating area) which is removable.  Has two live wells, one works properly, the other just needs pump installed.  I have the pump and other materials, just haven't installed it.  Does have an old foot controlled trolling motor.  None of the gauges work as it doesn't have the original engine.  Now to the engine.  The engine runs well but sometimes it is hard to start.  Not sure if it is fuel supply related or not??  My mechanic checked it out a few weeks back and ran well.  He checked the compression which he said was good in all cylinders.  He replaced the foot oil but said there was some water in there so it probably will need some new seals.  It does include the trailer and boat cover seen in the pictures.  So, that is about it.  I have owned it for about 4 years and again, just decided to step up to a newer, larger boat.  I have priced it low to sell quickly so the first $1,500 cash gets it.  It is located near Chucks Marina on Lake Martin and I live in Birmingham.  So, I would be able to show it only on the weekends.

The 220 is expansive and roomy with a ride as smooth as the lines in its gelcoat graphics. The sundeck interior features Varadense-cushioned captain's chairs for comfort. With almost 30 power options in single or dual-prop drives, 220 owners can choose the powertrain that matches their intended uses for the boat. Cobalt's plentiful storage areas feature: carpet where appropriate; rubber-matting where appropriate; they drain to the bilge when wetness might be a problem; they're lighted when necessary; and they're large. The ski locker easily accommodates knee boards. There are no unfinished spaces on a Cobalt. Standard equipment includes, walk-thru doors, a color-matched convertible top, leather steeling wheel with tilt, snap-in bow and cockpit carpet over finished non-skid surfaces, and a Sony digital sound system. Here too are a fully upholstered dash and flip-lip buckets. The 220's optional equipment includes transom showers, rosewood panels on the dash, starboard windshield wipers, port sleeper seats, swiveling cockpit tables, and stern curtains. The hull is totally hand-laid with seven layers of 1.5-ounce glass mat and 24-ounce woven roving, a signature Cobalt process called 'Hydrolam' resulting in consistency, strength, and integrity. Aluminum backing plates for all hardware are embedded in the fiberglass. A Kevlar - E-glass hybrid is applied over the entire length of the keel, chines, and strakes for impact resistance 10 times greater than conventional fiberglass at less than half the weight. AME 1000 vinylester resins bring superior strength, toughness, tensile elongation, and resistance to chemicals and water to the 220's deck and hull. All-fiberglass motor mounts and stringers constitute an integrally reinforced system for the suppression of vibration and noise. The Armorflex 953 gelcoat offers repairability, clarity, and high-gloss buffback, with blister resistance superior to standard gelcoats. Flexibility in the 953 gelcoat reduces cracking. A comprehensive two-year warranty guarantees the gelcoat finish against fading, crazing, stress cracks, air voids, and blister. Warranty protection on the 220: 10 years on the hull and deck structure and five years on the engine, sterndrive, intermediate housing, steering, and instrumentation. mercrusier 5.7 efi with just under 300 hours bow and cockpit cover bimini top freshly serviced Freshwater only Boat has been kept on lake martin its whole life one owner Trailer not included in sales price but available for purchase If you feel like this could be the right boat for you please call for more information or to schedule a showing.

Here's a boat that stands up to serious fun -- boarding, diving, a strong run to dinner across the bay -- and all in the family will find something to like in the 220. G-force acceleration and concurrent fuel efficiency. Handling that smoothes the chop and carves sweet, sweet slalom turns. For quieter moments, the 220 brings along legendary Cobalt emphasis on luxurious appointments and superior workmanship: a helm station dressed with rose wood panels and a matching leather-wrapped steering wheel, cloud-soft gunwale padding, sculpted lounges and reclining backrests, an optional sunpad center cushion which removes to form a walkway to the cockpit, cavernous storage, a sound system to dance for; and an extended swim platform.

Historically, Cobalt has emphasized the all-in importance of engine power, and the big, broad choices for the 276 ensure an appropriate blend of exhilarating speed and necessary fuel efficiency. The 276 has become an expression of Cobalt classicism in lines that whoosh and swoop toward the fully integrated swim platform, molded into the hull, creating the illusion that this boat never really does ride at anchor. 101 freshwater hours One owner Trailer not included in price but available for purchase If you feel like this could be the right boat for you please call for more information or to schedule a showing.
