Selling my boathouse at the Historic Madison County Boat Harbor on Hobbs Island Road. FIXER UPPER. Needs a good bit of wood framing and new sheet metal roof, but, THE NEW WOOD IS ALREADY IN THERE, $400 worth of new pressure treated lumber stacked and ready to go. I got an estimate for new roof metal at Pathways metal for $560. Boathouse is 20' wide and 30' long. It has a 14' wide inner slip berth. New management will require a level of insurance on boathouses you have to meet. Also maybe for sale, is my vintage 26' 1964 CHRIS CRAFT Cavalier. A solid project. This is the cheapest you will EVER get a boathouse. Mine needs work certainly, but for the right person, this is a great bargain. Sits in a deep water slip with an open space to the right, so you can spin it around for maintenance. Only one like that. Best location in the harbor. You can enter and exit the harbor with straight path to the mouth. Ditto Landing has recently taken over management of the harbor, the City of Huntsville has also committed 1.5 million dollars to make improvements to the greater riverfront area. This is a prime opportunity to make an investment in something that has much potential to increase in value. I just learned there are plans to replace the entire dock systems and enhance security measures. The tax assessment is $9.80 per square foot, appraised value is $5880.00. I have been asked this, in the eventuality the city wants to buy you out in the future, this is what the owner would demand. Look this up on the Madison County tax assessor website.

It is loaded with numerous features and is a joy to ride in on even in rough waters. This high freeboard Crownline cruiser has a lot to offer when it comes to cabin accommodations. Built on a beamy modified V-hull of solid fiberglass construction, the mid-cabin floor plan is arranged with a canted forward berth coupled with an L-shaped dinette/lounge across from the galley and a spacious head compartment. Privacy curtains separate the sleeping areas from the main cabin, and four opening ports and three deck hatches allow for plenty of cabin ventilation.

The main sleeping berth is located mid-ships at the stern end of the cabin and features a full sized bed.  There is also a forward berth for sitting or sleeping.  You do NOT have to convert the lounge into a bed so it can be used all the time for seating. The cockpit features LOTS of cushioned seating for passengers!  The captain's bench seats 2 people. The lounge seats 3 passengers.  The stern bench seat (removable) seats 3 people.  A removable jump seat holds 2 passengers. A rear facing bench holds 2 people. Due to the EXTRA WIDE 10.33 Ft.

The Volvo SX stern drives have been completely serviced and have new seals, boots, etc. The two engines have been fully maintained and they are in excellent condition. I have owned this boat for eight years and have had no mechanical problems with it.  The engines are strong and the boat comes out of the hole fast -- can even pull skiers up!  This Crownline has a top speed of 35 MPH and cruises at 27 MPH.  Regular oil changes and winterizations have been done. The boat comes with a conventional A/C air conditioner which cools the cabin to the 60's.  The unit may be plugged in to shore power while docked or powered by a portable generator while you are on the water.  There is ample room in the engine compartment if you care to add a marine generator and a/c.
