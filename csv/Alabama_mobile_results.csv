Since then I have put in the water 5 times..I am 80 years old and it is just to much for me to put it in and take out of water. The boat is in very good shape with some hairline jelcoat cracks. It has white upholstery with no tares. If you are a serious fisherman this is not the boat for you. It is a great family pleasure boat . I have had speed up to 38 MPH.
