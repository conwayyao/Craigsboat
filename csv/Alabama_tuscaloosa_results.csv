A Lowrance® fish finder comes standard along with 2 aerated livewells (1 livewell on the Stryker 16 SS and Skorpion) and convenient rod holder (locking rod lockers on the Stryker 16 SS). Enjoy sporty handling with your rugged helm console with tinted windshield and soft-grip wheel, or stick steer control and shift/throttle lever (Stryker 16 SS).

Length: 29 Ft.  Displacement: 10,500 lbs.  Minimum Draft: 2'11""   Beam: 10.33 Ft. (Add 1,000.00 lbs. for the trailer to determine total towing weight).  Bridge clearance -- 8'6"" This Crownline cuddy cabin / cruiser CR290 has a LOA of 31.17 Ft. and features two I/O engines which are Volvo Penta 5.0 L GL's.  It has two reliable Volvo SX I/O stern drives.    I have enjoyed the security of having two engines in the event one was to be damaged underway. This boat has a 10.33 Ft. beam and a very spacious cabin.  The entire hull is flawless and does not leak. The Volvo SX stern drives have been completely serviced and have new seals, boots, etc. The two engines have been fully maintained and they are in excellent condition. I have owned this boat for eight years and have had no mechanical problems with it.  The engines are strong and the boat comes out of the hole fast -- can even pull skiers up!  This Crownline has a top speed of 35 MPH and cruises at 27 MPH.  Regular oil changes and winterizations have been done. The boat comes with a conventional A/C air conditioner which cools the cabin to the 60's.  The unit may be plugged in to shore power while docked or powered by a portable generator while you are on the water.  There is ample room in the engine compartment if you care to add a marine generator and a/c. This 1999 boat and 2007 trailer are priced right to sell based on the NADA GUIDE, the Blue Book for Boats.  Average retail value for this CR290 Crownline Cruiser = $ 28,925.00 and the Loadmaster Trailer = $ 4,875.00 totals $ 33,800.00!  SEE LAST ATTACHED REPORT IN THIS LISTING ATTACHMENT FOR VALUE DETAILS. You can purchase the boat without the trailer for $ 21,900.00 FIRM.  The trailer can be rented to transport the boat if you want to purchase it. The boat and trailer can be bought for $ 24,900.00 OBO. Just to let you know, an example of the estimated monthly payment on a 10 year $ 24,900.00 boat loan at 6% interest is about $ 283.10 per month.  Your interest rate may be higher or lower.
