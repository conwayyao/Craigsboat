65,,"['64.027993', '-144.633943']",2016-11-13 18:37,"The first in shallow water freighter canoes and Alaska's first canoe company, Yukon Freightworks Canoe Co. builds epoxy resin (not polyester resin junk), UHMW armored canoes ready for any subsistence or work activity on Alaska's rivers and lakes. We are in our second year of production. Prior to production, these canoes were tested for a half decade on Alaska's rivers. These canoes were the basis of my senior project work at Alaska Pacific University, studying Sustainability Studies. Our canoes are an Alaska-grown solution, addressing fuel efficiency in the transportation sector. Due to the hybridized melding of a narrow flat bottom with a canoe hull, very little engine power is needed. All materials used for the construction of our boats are proudly made in the U.S.A. The name of the game is fuel efficiency, burning far less than half the fuel of a comparable jet-driven boat. These canoes are designed to be exclusively used with surface drive motors. The most preferred brand being Copperhead Mud Motors, due to great customer service and being the lightest ones made. The canoes will work well with traditional outboards too. Our freighter canoes can access locations that other boats, such as jet boats or air boats cannot. Our freighter canoes are the only viable fuel-efficient alternative to a jet-boat or air-boat for Alaska. With moderately heavy loads, such as a large bull moose, our freighter canoes consume about 1 gallon of fuel per hour going up rivers like the Yukon. For every hundred miles of river, you'll burn about 10 gallons of fuel. Going down river, usually 3 gallons of fuel or less. Try that with a jet or air boat.......... From hauling freight on the Yukon River, hunting moose and caribou, tending gillnets, dipnetting salmon, to running class lll whitewater rivers, these freighter canoes have been thoroughly put to the test. They can also be used as a drift boat for fly fishing, or paddled/rowed quietly during hunting season, only using the motor to get back up river. With the high prices of fuel paid by many of our state's remote communities, these canoes will help Alaskan families do work, haul freight and fill their caches or freezers for far less (fuel costs) than any other motorized boat. These boats are also ideal for Alaska-based federal or State of Alaska agencies trying to reduce fuel and maintenance costs. Call for options, pricing and general information. The 22 foot x 60 inch wide Alaskan Freighter Canoe: This freighter canoe offers the highest payload capacity of 3500 lbs. This massive freighter canoe is sufficient to push two hunters, two bull moose, and a heavy camp against rivers like the Yukon. This is the best platform for dipnetting. The preferred engine for this model is a 23 hp surface drive, or a 25-35 hp traditional motor. $10,200 The 18 foot x 58 inch wide Taiga Creek Freighter Canoe: This middle sized model is best for scouting wild, shallow whitewater rivers, and is versatile enough for all-around subsistence or work, having a payload capacity of 2800 lbs. The boat can be transported without a trailer, but only on 1/2 ton or larger trucks or vans with over-cab steel utility racks. The Taiga Creek can easily be ungrounded by one man, due to the slick UHMW armored bottom. This canoe can be paddled solo. The preferred motor is an 18 hp surface drive, or 20 hp traditional outboard motor. $8,785 www.freightercanoes.com Video of customer David's Taiga Creek Canoe (delivered for free to Fairbanks): https://youtu.be/UG5swJmVFCw Far North Bush Craft and Survival's thoughtful canoe trip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ7sBPyc5Oc https://www.facebook.com/FreighterCanoes *Update: All canoes now come standard with a new exoskeleton transom system: The Exoskeleton Transom System is all thick 1/8"" aluminum, CNC cut, and tig welded. It's unique, in that it comes all the way down the transom and captures the remaining seam of my 1/4"" UHMW armored bottom. It's also unique because everything is an integral one piece design: The end caps, inner transom plate, outer transom plate and above transom molding. The same thing with the bow caps, all tig welded 1/8"". The Exoskeleton system weighs about 7lbs. *Late fall through winter is the ideal time to place your orders, don't be seasonal or last-minute, demand and popularity has increased dramatically.
