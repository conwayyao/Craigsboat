39,excellent,[],2016-12-07 22:19,"Please note: I'm advertising in Alaska because I'm receiving more inquiries from here than the Seattle area... EXCELLENT general purpose all aluminum sport or utility platform. Year of manufacture approx 1984. Designed for oil spill recovery, this configuration is similar to a bowpicker / gillnetter or landing craft, but has a fixed bow... with a lot of load space. The offset house is 6' in length. While it is bare at this time, it should be adaptable for extended runs with a little ingenuity. The house is long enough for pipe berths. The original guards were industrial grade Johnson-Duramax bumpers, but seeing age, were just replaced with 2""x3.5"" UHMW guards for uncompromising protection... both inside and out, sandwiching the aluminum in between (and see photos showing both inside and outside bolted layers)... exceedingly strong! Current photos shows boat in a partially-finished state. The surfaces were slag-blasted and then the gunwales, transom, and deck protected with a 2-part epoxy E-Paint. The lower part of the house as well as a military-style 4-step radar mast to be installed and painted to match in the next few days. NEW: please note... last few photos show the 4-tier aluminum radar mast (military grade) sitting in the location where it should be permanently affixed... but it's meant to be tilted over backwards for trailer towing. Fuel capacity is approximately 140 gallons in a deck-mounted tank on the side of the house. Beam is 9' 3"" following the application of the UHMW guards. Stern mounted tow post and line guides both bow and stern. There are also 2-4"" tubes at port and starboard at the rear deck able to accommodate crab davits or hoists. In fact, this boat has 4 lift eyes for a crane AND can include a forklift movable land cradle (available separately for $1,000)... as seen inside forward deck in photos. The rearward engine guard (in photos) has been removed but can be included if you want to re-attach. Only the beam-width cross guard over the transom remains. There are 3 water-tight utility storage lockers over the transom. The deck has 5 scuppers... 3 of them threaded 4"" and 2 at the stern at 1.5"". There is also a bilge sump in the rear deck. EZ-Loader trailer included... bill of sale only for all components. Replacement cost hull alone is $80K. Your response time to events will be unmatched by combining the seaworthiness of this hull with an estimated 60mph performance from the 600hp power plants.

This is the same hull design as the original Nordkapp- the boat made famous on the first ever kayak expedition around Cape  Horn. The HS model I have for sale has a few minor changes. First, it has a larger cockpit opening for easier entry/exit. Second, it has a keel strip- nice for protecting the hull on landing. The most notable difference is the addition of a rudder. Most of the Nordkapp HS models have a skeg. Mine has a rudder. I prefer rudders to skegs, as I feel more in control of the boat. I also like the extra storage in the rear compartment from the absence of a skeg box. This boat was made sometime in the mid 90's. It has been incredibly well taken care of. I am selling this boat to finance the purchase of a bike, otherwise I have been really happy with it. I have had this boat for 2.5 years. I bought it to upgrade from my old rotomold Necky. It cruises at about 4.3 mph, thats at a medium aggressive stroke. I have had the boat up to 7 mph when digging in real hard, and in following seas I've gone even faster. Shes a fast boat for sure. This is not a beginner kayak. You will find when you get in its really tippy, but start paddling and you will find your balance. It is pretty stable once you get used to it. You can sit still in pretty flat water and do whatever you need to do. In chop wind and swells, you wont be looking through your binos, but reaching into your deck bag for something is still doable. What I really like about this boat is the high secondary stability. It feels like I can lock on to any edge and paddle there and the boat just stays on edge. It handles rough water very well, and rolls like a barrel. This boat includes a paddle and spray skirt. Here are some specs: Hull: fiberglass Length: 17' Beam: 20"" Cockpit: 16"" x 27"" Paddle length 220cm",,5883088485,60.132900,17,-149.398500,Valley,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@60.132900,-149.398500,16z",Nordkapp,$1300,human, (Seward),Kayak: Valley Nordkapp HS,https://kenai.craigslist.org/boa/5883088485.html,
