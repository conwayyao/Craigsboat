No mimimum holdback, regardless of how low it is, so send me your firm bid... Best offer gets the boat! Presently stored behind Tanner's Marine Service on blocks north of Douglas Island Harbor, Juneau, AK. 1978 CHB 39' Heritage Tri-Cabin Trawler Yacht. I bought it as a Live-Aboard knowing it needed a lot of work over five years ago, and lived on it with my wife for 17 months. Previous owners made numerous Inside Passage trips from Juneau to the Seattle area and back, averaging 2.5 GPH @ 7 Knots, making the run each way on a single fill-up of fuel at departure. They lived on it for over 15 years, but failed to maintain waterproof integrity of the cabin's windows and doors... Hence most of the wood under the fiberglass shell for the Cabin's exterior walls needs to be replaced, and a complete remodel has already commenced.  My wife's health issues required we move ashore, and now our projected plans to convert it into a swank floating condo that can cruise very efficiently have changed... This boat was our HOME, but now we don't need to support two homes if we can't live in both of them!  We've had to move to North Pole AK for employment, so please contact Tanner's Marine Service in Douglas, AK.  They have the right to negotiate sale and disposition of the vessel. The single Ford Lehman Dorset 120-HP Diesel Engine has been replaced with a nearly-new exact model (only 300 hours logged as an Emergency Fresh-Water Pump by the Chicago Water Department, who rebuilt & mothballed it until they sold it at a surplus sealed-bid auction 15 months ago, so it hasn't yet had sea water in the cooling system; engine alone is worth well over $10,000!). Borg-Warner Velvet-Drive 2:1 Transmission is in good shape. Twin-station controls from the Flying Bridge & Interior or Cockpit, since you need to reconnect them at your selected site. Controls presently removed from the Galley, with intent to relocate them to a planned new covered Cockpit astern. Hydraulic Steering readily facilitates locating the Lower Helm to your choice of sites. The Anchor Winch is presently gone, but theTwin Stern Thrusters are Engine-Driven Hydraulic.  Twin Fuel Tanks are Saddle-mounted, Stainless Steel, hold 450-gallons of Diesel; Polyethylene Twin Tanks hold 120 Gallons of Potable Water; Stainless Black-Water Tank hold 45 gallons of Waste. Queen-size State Room Suite astern with Macerator Flushing Toilet & Shower/Tub in Head. With her very strong hull, she has great potential, with lots of ""good stuff"" to work with... but the cabin needs a total build-out.  Our intent was to significantly enlarge the living spaces by  expanding to full-beam from bow to stern with an Upper Deck, reconfiguring to a ""Europa""-style Sedan with a raised Pilot House, kicking out the Stern with a Cockpit extension.  Potential value when work is completed should be over $150-G, even though present condition value as a ""Project Vessel"" is about $15,000, just in the components included... We will consider all offers, are prepared to take a hard loss...

69,excellent,[],2016-12-07 22:46,"Please note:  I'm advertising in Alaska because I'm receiving more inquiries from here than the Seattle area... EXCELLENT versatile all aluminum sport or commercial platform. Year of manufacture approx 1984. Designed for oil spill recovery, this configuration is similar to a bowpicker / gillnetter or landing craft, but has a fixed bow... with a lot of load space. The offset house is 6' in length. While it is bare at this time, it should be adaptable for extended runs with a little ingenuity. The house is long enough for pipe berths. The original guards were industrial grade Johnson-Duramax bumpers, but seeing age, were just replaced with 2""x3.5"" UHMW guards for uncompromising protection... both inside and out, sandwiching the aluminum in between (and see photos showing both inside and outside bolted layers)... exceedingly strong! The surfaces were slag-blasted and then the gunwales, transom, and deck protected with a 2-part epoxy E-Paint. The lower part of the house as well as a military-style 4-step radar mast to be installed and painted to match in the next few days. Fuel capacity is approximately 140 gallons in a deck-mounted tank on the side of the house. Beam is 9' 3"" following the application of the UHMW guards. Stern mounted tow post and line guides both bow and stern. There are also 2-4"" tubes at port and starboard at the rear deck able to accommodate crab davits or hoists. In fact, this boat has 4 lift eyes for a crane AND can include a forklift movable land cradle (available separately for $1,000)... as seen inside forward deck in photos. The rearward engine guard (in photos) has been removed but can be included if you wish to re-attach. Only the beam-width cross guard over the transom remains. There are 3 water-tight utility storage lockers over the transom. NEW ITEM:  Please note from last few photos a military grade 4-tier aluminum radar mast, which can be tilted over when the boat is being towed on a trailer.  It still needs to be affixed and painted same color as the hull. The deck has 5 scuppers... 3 of them threaded 4"" and 2 at the stern at 1.5"". There is also a bilge sump in the rear deck. EZ-Loader trailer included... bill of sale only for all components. Replacement cost hull alone is $80K. Originally intended to be mated with twin 300hp E-tec's, response time to events would be unmatched by combining the seaworthiness of this hull with an estimated 60mph performance from 600hp power plants.

Awesome boat that we have really enjoyed using to hunt, fish, and explore. Has more of a vee than older models-- handles chop much better. Selling because we upgraded to a slightly larger boat. I believe it has between 300-400 hours, but will be taking it to tanners for regular service at which time I will get a report showing the exact amount.  Has navigation lights, bilge pump, lowrance depth finder/gps(no chip), 12v outlet, USB outlets. Engine has both electric and pull start, as well as the ability to self-winterize.
