I did the full winterization (change all fluids and oils, all new filters, drain water, and fogg the motor). I also had them change the impellor so that will be good for a few years. Also while the outdrive was off I had them replace the outdrive trim sending units (looked like the wires were getting old). Finally they said the waterpump was starting to make a noise so I had them replace the water pump and hoses. So basically all the mainaince that should be done ever few years is done and ready to go. Great boat!  Signature series are upgraded trim/seats/and 5.7l motor.  Open bow.  390 hours on a 5.7L fuel injected MerCruiser.  Waketower with brackets for board storage (the aluminum bar you see in photos is a kayak rack and will be removed before the sale.  Stereo with speakers front, mid, rear, wake tower, and sub.  I use an aluminum prop (brand new) but also have a stainless for back up.  Adjustable trim tabs gets the boat on plane quickly and helps the boat on efficiency (just put in about $800).  Also have a complete boat enclosure kit that was only used once.  These are panels that zipper to the bimini and snap to the boat creating a tent so the boat can be used in colder weather and rain (cost $2500).  Also have a bow cover to snap on in bad weather.  Trailer dual axle with brakes, tires are brand new this season.  The boat has always been serviced every fall at Monte Vista Marine Now for the bad.  There are only three things wrong with this boat all of which dont  keep the boat from working. 1st the trailer trim tab that is located on swim dock doesn't work (either up or down).  THe trim still works being controlled at the throttle.  So there are two places to control the up/down of the motor and the one at the dock doesnt work. 2nd The top plastic handle of the throttle had broke off a couple years ago.  Everything still works as it should just doesnt look pretty (see photo).  I would have fixed it, but that part is no longer available without buying a totally new throttle assembly. 3rd the skeg is broken at the bottom.  It was like this when we got it.  We put an aftermarket skeg guard with plate and have no problems for five years. If you decide to get this before I winterize it we can go to a local lake for test drive and I will pay to winterize it along with the fall oil changes.  If you want to look at it after winterizing then you can come to my garage to look at it, but I would need a deposit to test drive it because it would then need to be rewinterized",390,5903095795,35.239871,20,-111.525822,Sea Ray,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@35.239871,-111.525822,16z",200 Signature Select,$10500,power, (FLAGSTAFF),1995 SeaRay Signature Select 200 REDUCED,https://flagstaff.craigslist.org/boa/5903095795.html,1995

79,excellent,,2016-11-08 15:30,"$1,500 for two-week houseboat time-shares at Lake Powell This deal is too good to pass up! $1,500 buys you 1/2 share in the corporation, which entitles you up to two permanent weeks on the boat annually. Average maintenance fees run about $1,250 per year.  Many choice weeks are currently available for 2016, 2017 seasons.  This is an excellent buy for newbies not yet ready for a 75-footer or for those looking to downsize from larger, more costly houseboats. Compare with rentals starting at $5,000 per week. We are looking for six new time-share members to replace recent retirees from the Skipper's Dream, located at slip M-18 at Bullfrog Marina, Lake Powell, Utah. The current members of the Skipper's Dream feel our houseboat appeals to a very distinct houseboat user.  We DO NOT want to take everything with us on the lake.  We are okay with no TV, no A/C, and no slide, and we are very happy with just enough amenities to keep us comfortable and relaxed for a leisurely week on Lake Powell on a dependable houseboat. We offer sleeping for at least eight (10-14 sleeping under the stars using top deck), 1 full bath with shower, and 1/4 bathroom, hot water and heater, complete kitchen with oven, stove, refrigerator/freezer, BBQ Grill, an additional deep chest freezer on the front deck and a generator for power. She has enough storage to keep you from tripping over everyone's gear. Compact at 47 feet, the houseboat is easy to maneuver, can fit many of the best (and tightest) campsites on the lake and can be handled by two people who know what they are doing.  Powered by twin 140-hp Mercruiser I/O gasoline engines, Skippers Dream was one of the plushest and fastest private houseboat when launched at Lake Powell in 1983.  She is still faster than any pontoon boat and is easier to drive and moor than a 75-footer.
