It has been babied and has only been on the water in Lake Havasu.  When we (the boat and I) were a bit younger we used it 5 or 6 times a summer, usually to go up or down river to find a beach and spend the day.   It does have a ski pole however we have never used it, so it has not even towed anybody.    I have always changed the oil and impeller every other summer.   I had the outdrive gone through last year and I have not used the boat in about 2 years. The NADA Average is $29,335 (see pics). This price does NOT include the following items that this boat has: 1) Captain chair upgrades - 2 up front and 1 at the helm 2) Sofa table with storage. (currently retails for $1000) 3) Gas BBQ These items would total more than $1000 if purchased separately. -A new boat cover has been purchased -New bunks have been made for the trailer but not yet installed. We're needing to downsize, but this has been a fun family boat with lots of room and storage. ASKING only the average NADA price of $29K due to some wear/tear/fading of upholstery and needed installation of the trailer bunks.  Cash Only. Located off  N. Palo Verde in LHC.

Velvet drive and a Walters v-drive. This boat has not been in the water since the mid 1970's. This is a one off boat. Here is the story: In 1964 Lee Shagsted, a general building contractor from the San Fernando Valley built a home for Billy Campbell of Campbell Boat Company. Lee asked Billy if he would build a boat for him. Lee had two concerns, first he wanted a pointier deck than the normal Campbell round deck. Second he didn't want a flat-bottom he wanted a deep V. So with that information Billy Campbell new a guy that built wood boats named Bayon. Bayon only built the wood hull. It went back to the Campbell Boat Company to be completed. They rigged it with a 426 Chrysler Wedge Motor with duel quads, Borg Warner velvet-drive and a Walters v-drive. Campbell Boat Company glassed the boat and did a complete show quality build on this boat. 35 years ago I ran across this boat and that was the last time it was in the water. I told Lee if he ever wanted to sell it I would be interested. Over the years I checked in with him time and time again and he always said no. In 2010 he called me up and said he wanted to sell the boat. After a couple hours I made a deal with him on the boat and trailer. The trailer is a tandem trailer with Western wheels. It is the original trailer that was built for this boat. This is an all wood boat. No rot. A couple cracks up on the top of the deck. The stringers are solid. It is a great survivor. This boat is offered for $5000.00.

It is a Gregor  welded aluminum and has an 18HP Tohatsu engine with top speed of 23mph(gps).  The trolling motor (with battery) is only one year old as is the gps fish finder.  It has vinyl covering on all the wood and a storage compartment for gas tank, life vest, etc.  Also included is an anchor and paddle.  It is set up with rod holders right at you finger tips. And of course the trailer goes with the boat. It also has brand new in the box pole holders for you to install.  I bought them for my new boat and they won't work on that boat so I took off the ones on this boat.  I bought a bigger boat because I decided I wanted to fish Lake Mich. in the summer and Lake Havasu in the winter and needed a bigger boat.  This Gregor does just fine on Lake Havasu.
