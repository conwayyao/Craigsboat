8,excellent,[],2016-12-19 00:58,"Okay, here's the deal. My wife and I have fallen onto some difficult financial times and are forced to either liquidate assets or make those assets generate income. We have decided to sell week long vacation packages on our 2001 75'x16' Sunstar houseboat accompanied by our 4 Honda Aquatrax F12X jet skies. This is not a time share, I say sell because I am offering a full vacation service of which I am personally present for and attending to the needs of each trip. This is much more than simply renting equipment or buying into a time share and I think that you will find it less expensive as well. Available 2017 weeks are as follows; Dec 28th, 2016-Jan 4th 2017 Jan 25th - Feb 1st Feb 22nd - Mar 1st Mar 22nd - 29th Apr 19th - 26th May 17th - 24th Jun 14th - 21st Jul 12th - 19th Aug 9th - 16th Sept 6th - 13th Oct 4th - 11th Nov 1st - 8th Nov 29th - Dec 6th For $6,000.00 (+ fuel and grocery costs) you will get 1 full week (Wed-Wed) aboard Too Much Fun (2001 Sunstar 75'x16' houseboat) as well as usage of 4 2005 Honda Auquatrax F12X jet skis and the services of an experienced captain, mechanic and avid Lake Powell boater. Included in your vacation package if you so desire is personal instruction in boating and water-sports. Boat comes completely stocked with everything you will need to make your vacation great. The boat has 4 state rooms and 2 bathrooms. The couch pulls out into a bed and there are stow-able pads for sleeping on the decks. The boat sleeps 10 in beds and parties of 15-18 are doable but do start to get cramped. All you would need to bring is your clothes and grocery's. For an additional $1,000.00 (+ grocery costs) we will even include a cook/maid. You send us a menu and we will do your shopping, stocking, cooking and cleaning for you. Two week vacations are possible if you so desire but will increase the package price as well as your fuel and grocery expense. Call to discuss extended vacation packages. Fuel costs are completely dependent on how far up the lake you want to go, how much you want to run the generator and how much jet skiing you do. We generally budget for $1,500.00 for 1 week. Likewise, grocery's are dependent on your party size and menu. We normally budget for $1,200.00 for 1 week and a party size of about 15 to 18. If jet skis and a cook/maid are not desirable options to your party, I will do one week on the just the houseboat for $5,000.00 (+ fuel and grocery costs) Deposit: A $1000.00 deposit will be due at time of booking which will be applied to the vacation package price. Deposits are payable via cash, cashiers check, wire transfer, money order or personal check. Payment in full: Vacation package balance to be paid in full 45 days prior to departure. If full payment is not received at least 45 days prior to departure date, your reservation will be considered canceled and your entire deposit will be forfeited. Balance is payable via cash, cashiers check or wire transfer. *Note, all reservations made within 45 days of departure date require full payment at time of booking. Damage Deposit: $2,500.00 refundable damage deposit will be due upon and in the same methods of payment as the vacation package balance. The damage deposit is not insurance. It's sole purpose is to cover damages caused by you or your party. Damages in excess of $2,500.00 will remain the responsibility of the purchaser of this vacation package. Cancellations: Cancellations made 60 days or more in advance of the departure date will receive a refund of any monies paid less a $100.00 cancellation fee. Cancellations made 45 - 59 days in advance of the departure date will receive a refund of any monies paid less a $500.00 cancellation fee. Cancellations made within 44 days of departure date will receive a refund of any monies paid less a $1,000.00 deposit/cancellation fee. Pets: House broken dogs are allowed and will be charged an additional $100.00 pet cleaning fee per dog. I want your trip to be one of comfort, relaxation and simply one that lasting memories are made from. I can only imagine the thoughts going through your head as you ponder whether or not to book a Lake Powell vacation from some stranger on Craigslist. Wanting you to feel completely comfortable, here's a little bit about me. My name is Brian and I have been married for 16 years. I have been a resident of Prescott Arizona since 1981 and have strong ties to this community. I have been boating on Lake Powell since 1985 and have been involved in houseboats for the last 10 years. I am a born again Christian and regular attender of Heights Church in Prescott, Arizona. I served in the army for a brief stent straight out of high school and am a 16 year veteran and current Lieutenant of the Yavapai County Sheriffs Office. Believe me, I have allot to loose by conducting bad business. I will be happy to provide references upon request. Please view the attached pictures and feel free to ask any and all questions prior to booking.

This listing is for 1/4 ownership in a 2001 Sunstar 75' x 16' houseboat (valued at $200,000.00), 1/3 ownership in 4 2005 Honda Aquatrax f12X jet skis (Valued at $23,000.00) and sole ownership in a 2012 Yamaha 242 Limited S runabout boat (valued at $43000.00). The houseboat is wet slipped on desirable G dock in Wahweap Marina with room enough to slip the 4 jet skis along side. She has 4 staterooms and 2 full bathrooms. Modern layout, furnishings and electronics. Twin Mercriuser 5.0 liter V8's w/Bravo 1 outdrives. 15 KW Westerbeke generator. Upgraded to solar power requiring little use of the generator. 3 water heaters, 3 refrigerators, 2 chest freezers, dishwasher, trash compactor and washer/dryer unit. 300 gallons of fuel storage w/toy pump on aft deck. 300 gallons of fresh water storage and 300 gallons of black water storage. Tons of extras (water toys, life jackets, dishes, cutlery, appliances, tools and supplies). You could literally show up with clothes and food and be ready to go. Top deck is covered by a large hard top main and canvas secondary bimini over fly bridge. This boat has tons of storage. We leave everything we need there so the only thing we haul to the boat with us is our grocery's. Small owner group gives you nearly unlimited access and a voice that actually makes a difference. Our weeks are set on a running rotation and are set for 2017 as follows; Dec 28th, 2016-Jan 4th 2017, Jan 25th - Feb 1st, Feb 22nd - Mar 1st, Mar 22nd - 29th, Apr 19th - 26th, May 17th - 24th, Jun 14th - 21st, Jul 12th - 19th, Aug 9th - 16th, Sept 6th - 13th, Oct 4th - 11th, Nov 1st - 8th, Nov 29th - Dec 6th. Weeks are tradeable w/other owners and monthly dues are set at $410.00 per month. That amount covers all annual costs for the boat and puts an additional $4,800.00 per year in the boat account for repairs/upgrades. Jet Skis are a matched set of Honda Aquatrax F12X 3 seat turbo's w/a top speed of 62 MPH. Plenty of power to pull with and stable enough to ride the channel on. All have matching covers and there are 2 tandem jet ski trailers that come with. Monthly dues on the skis are $26.00 per month which covers storage and insurance. Repairs and upgrades are split 3 ways unless damage was caused due to negligence and then the repair becomes the responsibility of the party responsible for the damage. Jet ski usage is in conjunction with assigned houseboat weeks. Boat is a 2012 Yamaha 242 Limited S. Plenty of power and very roomy for a 25' open bow. Has a wake board tower, a full cover and all filler cushions. Comes with tandem axle trailer. No monthly dues as you would be the sole owner of this vessel. Individually I am valuing the houseboat share at $50,000.00, the Jet Ski share at $7,600.00 and the Boat at $43,000.00. All together as a package I am only asking $92,000.00.

Tow it on family vacations or enjoy a day out on the bay. The floor boards can be removed and this boat can be folded and stored in 2 factory duffle bags with ease. The 40hp Yamaha Outboard is the perfect power-plant for this setup and has a top speed around 25mph. The motor has only around 15-20 hours of use and is in perfect working condition, also thoroughly cleaned and flushed after every use. This setup also comes with a full aluminum Pacific Trailer and tons of extras to include Lowrance Elite-7 HDI fish finder, all safety equipment, removable latter, anchor, front clip in storage bag and much more. I paid close to $12000 for everything this boat comes with and I have it priced to sell at $6500 but willing to entertain reasonable offers.
