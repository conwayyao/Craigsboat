She is made of wood - mostly pine with some oak. It is three-toned in color with the hull being solid white and the topside two tones of blue. The sail is white, has multiple stiffeners and is great condition - no holes or patches. The hull was refinished in 2015 after some fiberglass reinforcements and again it was recently ( 2016 painted using Interlux Brightside polyurethane high gloss enamel. I've only sailed her in fresh water lakes in Arizona and Idaho. The keel, which is made of oak, is the swing style and can be easily adjusted to various depths which makes for easy entry and exit in shallow water. She's a classic, yet at the same time, she's ready and easy to be sailed - even for a beginner. A trolling motor could possibly be mounted on the transom, however, I've never used one with her. The floor boards are solid wood and if a fresh - paint look is desired, some refinishing could be done here. The rudder and tiller are made of oak and are handsomely finished with clear spar varnish. The gudgeons are brass and stainless steel and operate smoothly. Both the mast and the boom are original wood and also finished in clear spar varnish. Most of her fittings appear to be original equipment and have a patina brass finish. The licensed trailer, which is included in the price, was painted in 2015, has custom carriages for the mast and boom. The tires are brand new just put them on yesterday. The old one were weather-checked and I didn't want the new owner to have to worry about this. I also just put brand new water tight LED lights on the trailer because the old ones had become unreliable.
