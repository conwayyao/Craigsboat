V TRAC HULL Deep, wide bows maximize steering control while minimizing shaking and porpoising for the best ride on big water. BETTER TRACTION Our hull strike designs give you better water traction, superior cornering and more overall control in all speeds and conditions. SELF-BAILING DECKS Self-bailing decks send water overboard where it belongs, for a dryer ride, more efficient cleanup and less deck wear.

A Striper ride is smooth, solid and assured. COMPOSITE TRANSOMS Stripers are 100% wood-free boats. Our composite transoms will not fail, and like the entire hull are warranted for life.
