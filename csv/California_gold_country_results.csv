Buyer will need to bolt the prop section back onto the outboard.

NOTE: I was originally offering the poles and tackle with the boat, but some people in my family want it. Honest Disclosure - This is a great fishing boat in fantastic condition offered at a fair price. However, while installing the new water pump, one of the (4) bolts that holds the water pump on broke off in the hole. It's not a big deal, but someone with a good tap and die set could get the sheared bolt out, then the prop half of the outboard will need to be bolted back onto the top part of the outboard. It's a simple job, - but it isn't done yet. See pics.

This boat skis, surfs, and wakeboards as well as it drives. It really has no weak point and that's something very few boats can say. Seating is also exemplary. The X30 has contoured seats in the back, a massive bow and a convertible rear bench seat, which fols quickly and easily between three different position. The dash shouldn't be overlooked on the X30. This is one of MasterCraft's best layouts. You've got the digital screen offset to the side and three massive analog gauges front and center where you can easily glance at them while underway. Beside the functionality, it just looks great. The X30 has classic MasterCraft styling inside and out.
