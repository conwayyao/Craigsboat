Center deck, mahogany dash. All original hardware is intact. It has original tandem axel trailer. Custom installation by Bill Gaylord Sr. in 1964. In that year, this Gaylord ""UN DONE"" had a 354 Chrysler with dual quads. It took little eliminator honors at the NDBA meet, as well as being judged ""TOP CUSTOM SKI BOAT"" in the 1964 Tri-Dent car show at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. This boat started out life a winner and you can make it a winner today. This tandem trailer has new tires on it, and the bearings have been serviced. You will see in some of the pictures where the floe cote in the floors ended up being thick in the center of the boat. The cracking you see is in the floe coat only. There is no damage in this hull and no rot. I have most of the original 354 motor parts block, heads, pistons, rods, crank shaft, harmonic balancer, adjustable push rods. They have all been cleaned and maged. The original block had some cracking in the side and I had that fixed and pressure tested. I can sell all the hemi motor parts for $3500.00 if anybody is interested. I have pictures of the motor that I can send you, and a lot more pictures on the hull.
