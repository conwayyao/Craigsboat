40,excellent,,2016-12-20 11:14,"This deal is too good to pass up! $1,500 buys you 1/2 share in the corporation, which entitles you up to two permanent weeks on the boat annually. Average maintenance fees run about $1,250 per year.  Many choice weeks are currently available for 2016, 2017 seasons.  This is an excellent buy for newbies not yet ready for a 75-footer or for those looking to downsize from larger, more costly houseboats. Compare with rentals starting at $5,000 per week. We are looking for six new time-share members to replace recent retirees from the Skipper's Dream, located at slip M-18 at Bullfrog Marina, Lake Powell, Utah. The current members of the Skipper's Dream feel our houseboat appeals to a very distinct houseboat user.  We DO NOT want to take everything with us on the lake.  We are okay with no TV, no A/C, and no slide, and we are very happy with just enough amenities to keep us comfortable and relaxed for a leisurely week on Lake Powell on a dependable houseboat. We offer sleeping for at least eight (10-14 sleeping under the stars using top deck), 1 full bath with shower, and 1/4 bathroom, hot water and heater, complete kitchen with oven, stove, refrigerator/freezer, BBQ Grill, an additional deep chest freezer on the front deck and a generator for power. She has enough storage to keep you from tripping over everyone's gear. Compact at 47 feet, the houseboat is easy to maneuver, can fit many of the best (and tightest) campsites on the lake and can be handled by two people who know what they are doing.  Powered by twin 140-hp Mercruiser I/O gasoline engines, Skippers Dream was one of the plushest and fastest private houseboat when launched at Lake Powell in 1983.

49,excellent,,2016-12-20 10:23,"Get the Biggest Boat that fits into an affordable 30 foot slip. This is a small yacht that is fully loaded and tuned up.  She is nimble and responsive.  A great vessel to Cruise, Fish, and Dive.  Best deal $/foot/usability on the market.  Affordable to run even at 17 knots.  She is ready to take you and your family to enjoy long weekends at Catalina Island etc. Cruise speed is 17 knots.  Troll all day at 7 knots.  Hull speed is 8.5 for longest range.  Top out at 20 knots.  The Uniflite hull is one of the best ever made.  Used dependably for years by many of the most knowledgeable boaters out there.  This one is a 1983 make.  One of the last years that they were made.  So this is Post-Blister construction and as dependable as you can hope to find.  They used good care in the lay up of the fiberglass and quality care in the interior wood fit and finishes.  This one is one of the rare Diesel powered ones.   ( No, not all Uniflite's are gas powered.  Do not price compare to gas boats! ) In 1999 she was re-powered her with super fuel efficient Cummins Diamond Series engines . A big step up from the Yanmars she did have.  Now at 220 HP on each side she gets up and scoots along cruising at 16 to 17 knots with ease, while using a frugal 1 GPM on average.  She carries 200 gallons of diesel and that makes most islands off of southern California your playground. Over the first 4 years I owned her I repainted and upgraded much of the boat.  Recently I re-did the non-skid decks and some touch up paint.  She is in bristol condition.  No wood outside to varnish.  Lots of beautiful woodwork inside for a classy yacht feel. If you like fishing or diving this boat is great.  She carries plenty of bait in two bait bags served by separate bait pumps.  If you SCUBA dive then you will love how she will carry 10 Scuba tanks in the two side racks designed to hold them securely while underway.  In any case you and your guests will enjoy a big roomy back deck to suit up or to fish from.  There is big deep diver friendly boarding ladder too. This big boat feel is best noted when you see the sizes of the back deck and upper deck.  You have room to work and play!  The back deck is your picnic area when in the harbor or on a mooring at Catalina Island.  A big Sun Shade is included at this price.  Recently I upgraded the boat with underwater lights.  One down and two aft. The super bright one down facing light is great for attracting fish or squid.  It gives off 4,000 lumen and only uses 2.8 amps of draw.  Or just use the aft facing pair of lights for mood lighting when entertaining at the docks or at a concert in the park with friends. The generator and toilet systems have been upgraded.  The front master's cabin was upgraded with a real mattress that is custom fitted to give you the most room and the most comfort.  You'll sleep like a baby on the mooring at the island.  Your main salon will sleep two in fold up bunk beds and 2 more in a settee table that folds down into a big double bed.  More sleeping area could be made up on the upper deck with it's two small fold down seats or with an inflatable mattress. The Bridge is very roomy for cocktail cruising in the harbor or for scoping out whales or marlin while at sea.  It is fully enclosed with isinglass.  It was enlarged, making a big, warm, protected space to drive with great views.  Room enough for 5 to sit and enjoy a cruise.  This raised helm area has very good views.  Much better than an express where you will not see the water directly in front of the boat.  This is a important safety feature, BTW. The controls are very responsive and laid out well.  Radar, Color GPS, ChartPlotter, Autopilot (connected to GPS for tracking), top of the line Fish Finder (new updated transducer May 2016), VHS radio with MSSI emergency coding, FM radio, cigarette lighter plug (for cell phone charging) and extra electrical available.  New Bottom paint just done in May 2016!  New Underwater Lights on the Bottom installed May 2016 that will attract bait.  Props and shafts out and tuned up at Wilmington Prop Shop in May**. The anchoring system is a big plus. 36 feet of big chain and almost 300 feet of rode for secure hold in most anchorages no mater the weather. 10:1 in 33 foot of water (Storm set).  7:1 in 47 feet for overnights or high winds.  5:1 for day anchorage or dive spots up to 66 feet.  Fishing stop or lunch stop in up to 100 foot of water at 3:1.  That is a lot of options.  She holds well and does not have a bad roll on the anchor.  Balanced load with wide fuel tanks and aft deisel engines will be appreciated by all your guests. So she runs great and will be a dream to own. Gotta see to appreciate.  If you are moving up from a gas boat or a trailer boat you will be really happy that you got into this one.  Not to be compared with a Bayliner hull or any of the gas boats in this category of 28 to 36 foot boats.  Quality holds it's value. Documented vessel.  All serious inquiries welcome.  If a qualified boater, I'll take you out for a quick little demo ride.  Please bring your wife/partner if married. She will like it too! Call me.  3 1 0 - 4 3 7 - 0 6 7 7 ** Wilmington Prop Shop is a big deal. The Shafts are perfect now and the Props are refreshed and cupped for the most efficient thrust etc.  This is indicative of how I have cared for the boat for the last 8 years.

You get the extras and the fresh bottom and new shaft logs and tuned props and new lights and new transducer etc. etc. Sorry...

Offered in open-bow or cuddy configurations, the 2670 is a good-looking fishboat with a large cockpit and an impressive array of high-end features. Her well-designed helm offers a wealth of digital information arranged for maximum visibility, and the standard leaning post includes a four-rod rocket launcher, tackle trays, and stowage. The 2670's factory T-top comes with a lifejacket storage area sewn into the underside, and a wraparound acrylic windshield protects the helm. Note that the sub-console compartment does not contain a head. In cuddy models, the cabin contains a double berth, marine head, storage, and rod racks.
