It has been completely redone with a full restoration.  Sale will come with a flash-drive of pictures of All pictures of restoration. I also have the original 12hp outboard motor that was just overhauled and runs great too. The original motor could use a repaint before put on the boat if you wanted a great clean classic look. I also have a box of extra parts that were collected during the restoration. The seats are very practical but can be removed easily.  They can be folded down. This is a fiberglass boat. It has been restored but it also has been used for fishing, cruising, swimming and all lake fun with the kids It is a boat that turns heads. It's classic look will only increase in value. As most other boats depreciate, this one will not. Cruise it, use it, enjoy it knowing that it is an investment rather than something that will not hold its value. I am negotiable on price.  I would like for another family to enjoy. Come check it out and make an offer. It is a great boat, runs great. Trailer is included and in good shape. The boat is very light and easy to tow. One person can move trailer for easy loading.  If you have any questions please get a hold of me.
