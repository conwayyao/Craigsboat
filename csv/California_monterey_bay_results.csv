The boat is equipped with new rear adjustable mount for second motor, fish finder, oar, anchor, sun shade, pole holders, etc. The inboard engine needs major work which I am unable to complete. I bought the boat thinking I would be able to get it running with a tune up but while checking the compression found that the three back cylinders on the right bank of the engine showed zero compression. All other cylinders checked out at a steady 180-185 PSI.  At the least it probably needs the head replaced. This would be  good buy for someone with the skills and interest in doing some engine work.

Package includes: -Minn Kota Trolling Motor console. - Group 24 Deep Cycle Trolling motor battery and original battery case. -""flush mount"" console for fishing without trolling motor. -Element seating system - Predator XL rudder system PADDLE IS NOT INCLUDED IN SALE This is an unbelievable kayak that is extremely fun to fish out of.  I've had it for one year and just got a new one.  The kayak is in excellent shape with no structural damage and only your typical loading and unloading wear and tear, and scratches from regular, and responsible, use.  There have been no holes drilled into hull for accessories but only have had holes drilled into the removable mounting plates that line the side of the boat.  These can be replaced for new plates if desired, otherwise the holes pose absolutely no issue for this boat.  All functions of this boat work perfectly. For more information on this kayak go to:  http://www.predatorkayak.com/xl-minn-kota/ Asking price is $1900 for everything, however I will entertain reasonable offers. Thanks NOTE:  I am also offering a NEW Malone Saddle Up PRO kayak roof rack mounting system if you need a rack.
