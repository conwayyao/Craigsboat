Twin 300s with Bravo 3 Outdrives Bow thruster for easy docking Partnership would offer use of my boat one day a week and one weekend day/night planned in advance. (More info here if interested) Harbor cruising only. Consider it a large duffy. I'm not interested in someone that wants to go deep sea fishing, ocean cruising or Catalina trips. I'd look for monthly payments of $600 after a security deposit of $5,000. Perfect boat for a someone that likes the harbor cruise lifestyle. Dock at Woodys, SOL/333, Cannery, Winery, or Pizza Nova. Anchor in the harbor and watch the sunset. Relax on the boat while in the slip and kids swim off back end. Always a good time in Newport Harbor. Invite friends, enjoy drinks and food as you cruise and dock and dine. Pictures include various spots to dock at. During winter months the Eisenglass enclosure is up.
