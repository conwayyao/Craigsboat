Included is all the following plus more. Life vests, inflatables, wakeboard, marine tool kit, extra belt for motor, air compressor, fire extinguisher, throwable cushion (last 2 are safety and if you dont have you get a ticket), beach chairs, cooler, ropes and more. I don't need to sell my boat but I am not using it much anymore (maybe 1 time every 2 years). It cost me $36 a year for registration. I would like someone to have it that will use it more. I am the 2nd owner of this boat, I bought it off of my best friends grandparents back around the year 2000. It has been in a garage all it's life and right now it is just collecting dust. Pretty much every year I do some kind of upgrade or maintenance. Most recently I did 2 Blue top Optima batteries and a new alternator. Both where not bad but I knew it was about time to replace and if you have every been stranded on the water you know that doing this now is better then doing it later. Actually now that I think about it I have never broken down in this boat. Unless you count when I ran it out of gas coming up river to the launch, it was late and no gas open on the river. Worst thing! I was only 1/2 mile from the boat ramp and ya can't float up river. Good times! The boat is completely still stock, I haven't had a problem with engine ever so never did any upgrades. If it ain't broke. All my friends would say 'you need to put a blower on this thing' I'd say 'Nope! Blowers just cause problems, it does 60+ I'm good' Engine is a Hardin Marine Chevy Big Block 454. With a Berkeley Jet Pump. Hydraulic Jetovator with 2 wedges. This thing washes cars going under bridges (not illegal but will get ya pulled over if rangers see ya, then of course they will want to see all your safety equipment so they can give ya a ticket for something) but I am including all that safety equipment so no ticket! Trailer is a dual axle trailer with 80+% tread on tires. Pulls perfect even at 90 mph. Also 2 years ago I put a new stereo head unit in. One that has bluetooth, old one didn't and had to connect via a cable. I haven't used the boat since and it is time for me to part with it to someone that will enjoy it as much as my friends and I have. This is a turn key ride! You won't need anything else for lots of river fun unless you want it. People forget or don't realize after you buy a boat how much other stuff you need to buy. 6 seats = 6 life vests. You can get several thousand in the extras. All most forgot the stereo, 2 12"" woofers up front in a baffle board. Thing pounds with huge amp to run everything.
