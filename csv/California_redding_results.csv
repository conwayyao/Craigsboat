18,good,"['40.743750', '-122.238705']",2016-12-19 13:50,"Winnonah ""Champlain"" 18' Kevlar canoe.  Includes beautiful wooden paddles ($1300 with paddles)  Canoe is yellow Kevlar with adj tractor seats.  The entire beautiful boat has black metal trim.  Canoe weighs 46lbs $1,200 or best offers.  More pictures available upon request. Here are the factory specifications bellow of the Champlain General Touring / Champlain A versatile design with enhanced efficiency and seaworthiness. A larger, more stable version of our versatile Spirit II, the Champlain has the efficiency and capacity to haul heavy loads long distances, but is also pleasant to paddle lightly loaded. The Champlain is one of our largest tandems. It also has fullness for much of its length, giving it even greater volume than its dimensions suggest. It gets excellent stability from its size, and from its shallow-arched hull, a design that is less sensitive to waves and easier for paddlers to handle. As its name implies, the Champlain is a confident craft to face big swells on vast waters. More than safety alone, it delivers performance that makes crossing big lakes practical. Its length and profile give good speed and glide, which it retains very well with a load. Its slightly rockered keel-line also lets it turn quite easily for its size. Good uses for this design? We recommend it highly if two or more of the following conditions apply: big people, big loads, or big waters. This canoe hauls two large people, a week's worth of equipment, plus an arsenal of fishing gear, and it still has reserve buoyancy for waves.

They are ideal for speed and distance paddling and for all people or conditions that demand the lightest gear. In our Ultra-light construction a structural-foam core and ribs are laminated into the hull and sides. We also add extra fabric layers to strengthen specific targeted areas. Aluminum plates are strategically laminated into the hull. Seats, footbraces, and all hardware is then riveted into these plates. This gives a very secure connection and eliminates rivet heads on the exterior. Kevlar®, the fiber used for aerospace, body armor and bulletproof vests, is amazingly light and strong. We've used it for more than 30 years to construct extremely light and tough canoes. Wenonah Canoe is the worlds largest maker of canoes using Kevlar®.
