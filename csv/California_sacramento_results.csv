He has asked me to sell the boat for him. It is a 19ft Fibre Glass boat with a 6ft beam. The trailer alone is worth the price. There are no papers on the boat, or the trailer, but it can be sold legally.  He told me a Lean can be filed on both (by the buyer, or by me) and he will not contest it, so there are no problems with the sale. It comes with trailer and 350 Chevy engine.
