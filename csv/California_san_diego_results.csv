3,fair,[],2016-12-20 14:09,"The Shelter Island Marina is holding an auction on Thursday, December 29, 2016 at 11am. Up for auction is a 1977 37' Tayana. Starting bid is $10k. Showing will begin at 10am. I do suspect that, based by the exterior, the boat is likely worth much more than $10k. Rules: 1. The boat will be sold ""as is, where is"" 2. There is a 10-day redemption period, beginning the date after the auction, by which the current owners may make good on their debt and retain the vessel. The winning bidder will have to wait this period. 3.According to the lien sale company who we rely on for the sale, there are no known taxes due on the vessel. However, if for some reason it arises that taxes are due, a new owner will be liable. This is true for any lien sale. We are confident with the search conducted by the lien sale company. 4. All expired registration fees and possible property taxes must be paid when registering the vessel. 5. The boat may make for a nice cruiser with some elbow grease and attention. However, it is not quite up to par with the other boats in our marina. Therefore, the new owner will have 2 weeks to remove the vessel from Shelter Island Marina. This 2-week period will begin after the 10-day redemption period has ended. 6. The boat will not be open for viewing the interior. This is because, until the 10-day redemption period is over, the boat is still owned by the soon-to-be previous owners.",,5927363547,,37,,Tayana,https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%32%30%35%31+Shelter+Island+Dr+San+Diego+CA+US,,$10000,sail, (Shelter Island Marina),Auction! 37' Tayana Cruising Sailboat,https://sandiego.craigslist.org/csd/boa/5927363547.html,1977

Used: we took it out 15 times in the bay for Humphrey's concerts with 4 passengers in the past 5 years owning it. This dinghy has some signs of cosmetic wear and imperfections (some holes have been patched), but is fully operational and functions as intended.  One seat and two oars or paddles.  There is no inflatable floor.  We had wood and carpet cut out but aged, so sold without floor.  The dinghy is rolled up and covered so no photos available.  The Tohatsu 2.5 HP motor is an old 2-stroke but it starts every time.  Registration tags good thru 2017.  Either sold together for $500 or separately - dinghy $300 // Motor $200 ----- CASH ONLY.
