0,good,,2016-12-20 14:24,"2002 Hobie Tiger F18 class-legal racing catamaran for sale.  This is a great low-cost introduction into the fun and thrills of F18 racing.  She has been an excellent trainer for me, but the time has come to move up into a faster, more competitive F18.  Selling for $1000 less than I purchased her for three years ago and I have put thousands more into her. She sails great, but is not in pristine condition.  All new running rigging for 2016 and a new spinnaker with only a few races on it.  Carbon main in good condition; older dacron main without headboard.  Carbon racing jib is older but works well; several older dacron jibs.  Trampoline has one tear.  Hull is solid but could use some cosmetic repairs on the port bow.  Dagger boards could use refinishing.  Boom is slightly bent but completely functional.  Boom and sprit were new in 2015.  Has SNU spinnaker snuffing system.  No cover.  Hiking boards are included (I've never used). Comes complete with serviceable trailer including trailer box and sail tube.  Hardware to convert the trailer into a double-decker is included. She is not Bristol, but she is not a project boat; she is ready to sail and have a blast on.  She is very fast and I've had her over 21 knots in about 18 knots of wind.  In less breeze, she moves like a dream and is smooth to sail. I've had a lot of fun with the Tiger, but have the opportunity to move up to a newer boat and would like to find a good home for her.",,5927347248,,18,,Hobie,,Tiger,$5500,sail, (vallejo / benicia),2002 Hobie Tiger F18 Catamaran,https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/boa/5927347248.html,2002

I am offering for sale one of my favorite pieces, ""Pacific Pursuit"".  This particular piece was created using a heated metal stylus, burned by hand, into a plank of carved basswood.  It measures right around 30"" long, 11"" tall, and 2"" thick.  I would be willing to personally deliver a piece to a serious buyer. It would be a welcome excsuse to get out of the studio and on the road (as long as you are in northern Ca, that is). This is definitely not a piece for someone that is satisfied with a production piece, or something computer generated or laser engraved. I'd truly like to find a collector who enjoys art that is handcrafted, something an artist created one time, with originality and heart. I put over 100 hours into creating this piece, carving, sanding, hand stylus burning, and finishing. I take pride in not only anatomic accuracy, but tend to obsess over textural detail as well. I will gladly provide additional images, information, etc, to any serious collector. I'd love to chat and give you any background information on my work. Please feel free to contact me at show contact info or email me. Im also on facebook, and my site is travishinshawartistry.com. As a side note, the other half of this slab bacame a piece featuring bowhead whales, diving beneath the arctic ice, and sold at the Westhaven Center for the Arts, in Humboldt county, for 1500.00. I am willing to find an appreciative buyer for substantially less, as it would assist me in financing my next artistic project, woodcut printmaking. Thank you for your time.

29,like new,,2016-12-20 11:57,Tossing around the idea of selling my baby to get a multi purpose hunting/fishing boat. It is a 1997 ranger 488vs (21 ft) 200 Mercury efi oil injected to stroke motor. (Does roughly 68-70mph with a light load) Good compression Newer tires on trailer (with new spare) New seats New carpet New min Kota fortex trolling motor ($1200) Live wells with aerators work as they should. Hummingbird fish finder up front Lowrance at helm Not sure on models of each fish finder if you are interested would be happy to provide more details on them. Stereo system works Locking rod lockers Deck extender (easily fish 3-4 people off this boat) I'm sure I'm forgetting stuff. This boat runs awesome. This is arguably one of rangers best hulls. Handles choppy water better than any other bass boat out there. For as big as it is it gets up and goes. No issues to complain here. Top cap could use a good wax in the near future as well as the fenders. Otherwise in amazing shape. Always kept under a car port with sides to keep sun and weather as well as a custom fit cover over it. (Included) I'm open to trades for a newer aluminum boat? Only reason is I'm looking to down size to a more fishing/hunting boat. Like a Lowe or tracker? I know values so it must be newer 2000s. Camo would be preferred like tracker 1754sc but shoot me what you got worse I can say is no. Again I'm in absolutely no hurry. My price is firm. It's currently registered with pinks for both boat and trailer. Just went fishing last weekend.
