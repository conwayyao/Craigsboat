It is an incredibly stable and fast kayak for its size and weight.  We had it modified by re-cabling the entire steering system as well as changing the steering from the back seat to the front.  In addition to that we added an Onno steering bar in the front seat, and a foot bar in the back.  These improvements make it a great design for river racing as you can make quicker and more accurate steering choices from the front, and with the Onno bar your legs and feet are more ergonomically balanced for an ultra distance race. The Untiy is designed for sea kayaking and touring, with plenty of hatch space. ""The Current Designs Unity is a sit-inside touring kayak with a V-shape hull, padded seating, and a 2 person person seating capacity. As a touring kayak, it is designed to travel long distances in open (and potential rough) water. Experienced kayakers will find these kayaks are easier to track in a straight line, more maneuverable in rough waters, and can go faster. It will also have more storage space than the average kayak - enough for overnight outings.""

The boat is 100% reliable and the engine is in perfect condition -- cranks every time. For the right price, it will come with all the toys (wakeboard, skis, tubes, ski jackets, and ropes). Families interested in equal doses of skiing, wakeboarding, tubing, and entertaining will find the MariStar 210 the boat that fits every bill. There is ample room to store lots of gear under the seats, under the back-hatch sunpad, and even below deck in the ski locker. And with several 12-Volt power take-offs, you can bring and blow up 3 or 4 tubes while on the water! Best of all, parents and children alike will feel at ease knowing that the MariStar's propeller is tucked safely under the hull. The MasterCraft MariStar 210 VRS is a paragon example of what a 21-foot luxury wakeboarding and skiing boat should be. There is space and fun for the whole family! The 210 features a deep-V bottom for a soft ride, a driver's command center for complete cockpit control, a high-powered V-8 engine and all the high-tech composite materials found in every other MasterCraft. It's tailored with a wood grain dash, high-quality vinyl seats, and marine carpet. The driver's seat is also designed for maximum comfort and it swivels to allow you to join the party and slides back and forth to find the perfect driving position for you. It also has a marine Clarion stereo, 6-disc CD player, and speakers, perfectly positioned throughout the contoured wrap-around seating and in the open-bow.
