Lucid Lu, I never painted the name on but I named her for the manifestation of a lifelong dream. Turn and go. Purrs like a kitten. Relatively new upholstery, and a Bumping stereo system. Cozy front cabin for overnighters. Jam from the harbor to the islands in an hour flat on a calm day. In the two years that I've owned her I've: been on half a dozen islands trips, had the engine cleaned and serviced, re-painted the trailer and replaced the trailer jack, replaced the batteries, made a whole lot of memories. She's looking for a new home; a fellow dreamer and nautical adventurer. What works: engine, stereo, radio, most of the electronics, everything important. What doesn't work: a few of the gauges on the dash. That's about it to my knowledge. Fully equipped to coast guard standards. What's included: 2 anchors, life jackets, bumpers and plenty of line, mobile charger/battery jumper, wakeboard (if you want it), Hawaiin sling (if you want it), fish finder (not sure if it works, I never used it), token hula girl, whatever else I forgot to mention....

It is a very comfortable boat with a fairly new and economical diesel engine, located in a slip in Santa Barbara Harbor.  I do not use the boat that frequently as I have a bigger boat to use.  Very informal arrangement but looking for someone who can sail this boat with some expertise without me being on board.  This would make me feel secure knowing that the boat would be taken care of and sailed conservatively in local waters, in good weather conditions, on a day-sail, non-overnight use basis.

Lucid Lu, I never painted the name on but I named her for the manifestation of a lifelong dream. Turn and go. Purrs like a kitten. Relatively new upholstery, and a Bumping stereo system. Cozy front cabin for overnighters. Jam from the harbor to the islands in an hour flat on a calm day. In the two years that I've owned her I've: been on half a dozen islands trips, had the engine cleaned and serviced, re-painted the trailer and replaced the trailer jack, replaced the batteries, made a whole lot of memories. She's looking for a new home; a fellow dreamer and nautical adventurer. What works: engine, stereo, radio, most of the electronics, everything important. What doesn't work: a few of the gauges on the dash. That's about it to my knowledge. Fully equipped to coast guard standards. What's included: 2 anchors, life jackets, bumpers and plenty of line, mobile charger/battery jumper, wakeboard (if you want it), Hawaiin sling (if you want it), fish finder (not sure if it works, I never used it), token hula girl, engine oils and gas additives, .....
