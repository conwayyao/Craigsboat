19,good,"['38.037700', '-121.344500']",2016-12-19 22:01,"This is a 28' 1978 Fiberform.  It has been taken out of the water. This is an awesome fishing or cruising boat.  You can tube behind it as well.  It is the most comfortable fishing boat I have ever been on.  Four people can fish off the back deck at once, easily.  It trolls slow enough for salmon or striped bass. It has a 10' beam.  It has a shallow draft, but I am unsure of it exactly.  It has a flying bridge, with dual helm control.  We had a swim platform built out of fiberglass, that will probably outlast the boat.  The boat is in overall good condition, with two problems that need to be fixed.  Neither are major issues.  The first is the canvas at the back of the cabin needs to be replaced, the zippers have been UV damaged.  And the second, is the stove needs to be sent back to the manufacturer and be replaced.  One of the previous owners left fuel in the stove for who knows how long in it and O-rings and seals need to be replaced.  It is a marine alcohol stove. It has twin Ford/OMC 302 V-8 engines, at 175hp each.  The starboard engine was completely rebuilt in 2012.  It has 50 hours on it since the rebuild.  And the port was rebuilt in 2007.  It has approx. 175 hours on it since it being rebuilt.  The port is approximate, it was done by my ex-wife's uncle before I bought it.  The outdrives are OMC stringers.  The tilt motors were replaced when the starboard motor was rebuilt. The upholstery was redone in 2010. The electrical is 12v, with 110 installed to outlets, separately form the 12v system.  It has a Guest Charge Pro, Model 2632, to charge the batteries.  I use a small generator plugged into the shore power when we stay the night.  It has 2 Die Hard Platinum 31m AGM batteries. I believe they are 3 years old, but in excellent condition.  And it has one Optima Marine AGM battery.  I am not sure of the age, but it is in excellent condition as well. The basics inside: There is an electric flush toilet in the head.  It is a small head, but has a door and is enclosed inside.  The head is connected to a septic system. There is a 30 gallon water tank for the sink, that has a low pressure pump. I installed a Humminbird 998c GPS Fishing system.  It has side imaging.  I installed two transducers and the temp/speed sensor. A Sony DSX-ms60 CD player was installed this year. A marine VHF radio, unsure of the brand.  And the antenna is in excellent condition. There is a ice box, ""fridge"".  You put ice in it and it works similar as an ice chest. There is storage inside of the cabin and a coat closet. We slept five in it.  Four in the bow (one of the four was my young daughter) and one on the table that drops and makes a bed. We set it up to run a small AC through a port window, when the generator is running. The back deck has a fish box, but we us it for storage.  There is no canvas, except for the Bimini top on the flying bridge.  The windows have covers, but I never checked to see if they were all there.  On the bow is a Lewmar Pro Sport Windlass, it is setup with the wireless system, and a switch on the inside. Not included with the boat, but available for sale to the purchaser of the boat first, is the 35' Zieman 3 axel trailer.  It as six new tires, four new brake plates, new bunks and carpet.  The trailer needs no work to be done on it.  The paint may be faded, but it is in excellent condition.  If the buyer does not purchase it, I will sell it separately then. Also not included in the sale of the boat, is the Honda 2000i generator.  But possible arrangements can be made to purchase it.
