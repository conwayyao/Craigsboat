65,excellent,"['38.640400', '-75.604100']",2016-12-17 17:43,"First of all I am open to a barter of a Bay type boat of equal value. I do not want a big one, but one that rides good in rough water. This is the most stable, easiest to maneuver , pleasure to fish, or tour, downright FUN kayak ever. Here is what your buying. First of all a 15' ocean blue , Ocean Kayak, with full running lights, stereo system, with blue tooth, two accessory battery boxes waterproof incl. batteries, Fish finder/plotter color screen, plenty of storage. But this is not all. It comes with a brand new all aluminum trailer , very stable. Full running lights and anchor lights, horn, electrical control panel, full stowage milk basket with a lockable rod holder for three rods and reels. Two trolling rod holders, storage tray to cut bait or hold lures, enough space in the crate to hold three plastic lure boxes. Oh, you thought that was it? Heck no, it comes with both a built in stabilizer outrigger which are easily removed when transporting, Stand and Fish system, a full back support stand and lean tower, with built in lights. Wow, you cannot ask for anything more, right? Oh wrong sir, its also has a 55# thrust electric motor, with foot controller for turning which runs all day on one charge. Electric motor has five forward speeds and three reverse speeds. Its control switch is hand made solid wood, and right between your legs for quick and easy access. Paddle holder installed, plus one year old deep dry cell battery. This can all be transported via a vehicle as small as a Honda Fit, which is exactly the vehicle I use to take it for launch off of Sandy Point , or even Black Hills for fresh water fishing. This is the quintessential fishing machine for a guy who wants to pay next to nothing, for a day of fishing, who is a serious fisherman enjoying quality equipment. The battery last all day and has plenty of juice left at the end. If you run the motor on high all day it will last about four hours of full run time. Now here is the thing. The boat was put together for a avid fisherman who loves to use a Kayak for his adventures. It has everything other then a bedroom or bath. I have tested each and every item on this boat and it all works flawlessly. I put this whole thing together except for the electric motor, which was professionally done. It is top of the line, nothing spared related to cost. Garage kept. I fish at the rocks at the 'Bay Bridge quite a lot, and this boat handles choppy water better then anything on the market. The trailer is brand new and one new spare tire included. If you are calling to lowball me, please just go onto the next listing. After pictures were taken I added an adjustable seat that no longer sits level on the kayak floor, but is raised so your legs never get cramped up. Again this vessel was both tested and tweaked to assure a relaxed day of fishing, care and trouble free. I left open one electrical connection bar open, in case you want to add a digital TV. lol I tow this with a Honda Fit, no joke and its almost like nothing behind the vehicle. The drive to Black Hills is about 75 miles round trip and to the bay bridge its about 60 round trip and the trailer has no jumping, no shifting, no sliding in the least. Kayak is now in a garage in Baltimore Harbor, but I plan on moving it down to Seaford , Delaware shortly so it can be viewed at either place.",3,5919751019,38.640400,18,-75.604100,Ocean,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@38.640400,-75.604100,16z",Prowler,$3400,power, (Delaware),"Kayak, Ocean Prowler 18'",https://delaware.craigslist.org/boa/5919751019.html,2012
66,excellent,"['38.640400', '-75.604100']",2016-12-17 17:43,"If you wish to find a rare boat. If you love classic lines, classic looks, 50's retro , rarer then rare, then this is the boat. Completely finished, top of the line, matched with the same chassis as it was purchased back in 1956 as a matching set. This is not a one of a kind, but it is a one of about 9 known to exist. They were made from 1956 , 57, and ended in 1958. Hardly two were the same considering they were made from scratch without pre-fabrication. Crestliners offices were burnt down in the 70's which many of its archives were lost in the fire, but historians of these boats say about 73 in total for all three years were made. Very few still exist and even fewer exist in this condition. I believe it is the best one left on any market. I will give the local East coast market first shot , then it will go to Ebay in the spring of the upcoming year. Vessels name is Rum Runner, top speed just about 40mph, maybe a little more. Boat and trailer as I had said, was bought by the original owner together, who owned this boat from 1956 to 2012. The trailer name is a Tee-Nee. The man died in 2009 and his wife held onto the vessel until 2012 when she passed away , their son sold it to another, who sold it to me. It had been kept in Wisconsin its entire life in a garage on a lake and only used during their summer vacations. The motor was bought out of Vermont from a dealer who had taken it off of a pontoon boat, whereas the guy who had the pontoon boat bought it new in 2010 , used the pontoon boat twice, his wife got sick and he winterized it at the dealer lake location in the winter of 2010 and never used it again until he sold it to the dealer in 2014. I picked it up in the summer of 2014 and had it all gone through by a high end mechanic. All carbs were cleaned and engine was in perfect condition when he left. I am more then willing to take any financially approved buyer for a nice ride. I can be reached at Four Four Three- Nine Nine 6- Eight two hundred. Thanks for reading , Peter It contains one outstanding sound system, Bluetooth set for Ipods or MP3 players, four speakers that will knock your sox off with the sound this system makes. Brand new windows throughout, installed to perfection, all new wooden interior made of Alaskan Cedar, with all new cushions. Electrical system contains all new wiring, new Perko switch, new fuel / water separator, new bilge pump, two new batteries, new GPS/Fish Finder/Plotter Lorance installed, new hard impact gas tank 16 gallons, new receiving hose for gas and sealed top filler. All steering system is new installed, all new pulley's, attached to a 50 HP Honda with less then 20 hrs. on the motor. No joke this baby has it all. You can buy the normal wooden so called classics, having nothing but yearly maintenance, all the wooden upkeep needed, or buy this all aluminum classic gem. This is no diamond in the rough, it is the quint essential sparkling beauty diamond, all finished and ready to drop into the water. I just had all new covers made that match everything quite nicely. This is as rare as a good wife, with laryngitis. Perfect cruiser, with a removable wine table for the rear. Take her out for an evening on the water with friends, eat , drink and be merry. Perfect river cruiser. I cannot tell you how many compliments I receive from those who see it. My problem is I mostly fish the open bay. This is not a bay boat. So I am also open to a trade of equal value, or trade and give me some dollars back. I dropped the price by $1000. Due to its condition and rarity it is most definitely worth that price by far.",20,5919741789,38.640400,18,-75.604100,Crestliner,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@38.640400,-75.604100,16z","Voyager, Hardtop",$14500,power," (Seaford, delaware)",1956 Crestliner Voyager Hardtop 18',https://delaware.craigslist.org/boa/5919741789.html,1956
