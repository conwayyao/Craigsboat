The Hatteras 58 Yacht Fisherman is essentially a 53 Motor Yacht with the addition of a 5-foot cockpit extension. She was introduced in 1970, just a year after the Hatteras 53 MY was launched, and she enjoyed a long and very successful production run during the next twelve years. The 58's cockpit makes her a more versatile and better handling boat than the 53 MY, and the additional fuel capacity results in a GREATER CRUISING RANGE. Belowdecks, her three-stateroom, galley-down floorplan is the same as the 53MY with the helm open to the salon and separate walk-in engine rooms. The Aft deck is sheltered by a bridge overhang and fitted with wing doors for wind and spray protection. She is powered with the Detroit Diesel 8V-71TI's which cruise at 16-17 knots. Still a popular yacht in spite of her age, resale values remain quite strong.",1255,5901314796,,58,,Hatteras,https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%31%30%30%30+US+Highway+%39%38+Carrabelle+FL+US,58 Yacht Fisherman,$199000,power," (Carrabelle, Fl)",1973 Hatteras 58 Yacht Fisherman,https://miami.craigslist.org/brw/boa/5901314796.html,1973
