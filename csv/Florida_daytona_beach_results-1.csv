The Alden 18 uses the patented Alden Oarmaster drop in unit. Weighing only 18 lbs, this self-contained sliding seat unit can be inserted and removed in seconds making it quite easy to convert the boat from a single to double, or even to take a passenger. The 18 features the same hull design as the Alden 16, but is a bit longer with a stiffening section to maintain rigidity when loaded. The large cockpit has extra space for storage and touring. The double has been rowed all over the world, including an coastal adventure from Alaska to Washington State, loaded with gear. Even on shorter trips, you will appreciate this shell's stability and versatility.

Boat and motor are in great shape.  Boat has the following features:  navigation lights, front casting platform, anchor storage, center console seating with storage, T-top, T-top storage box, marine radio, leaning post, numerous rod holders, floor livewell, dive platforms, custom motor bracket, trim tabs, deck lights etc.  This year I put in a brand new bilge pump, new steering wheel and brand new Sunbrella cover on the T-top.  The motor had a full service in April of 2016 and we replaced the electronic controls unit (ECU).  My family ran this boat every weekend all summer long going to the island, fishing the jetty, chasing cobia, tarpon and running offshore.  Anyone who knows these motors, knows they are reliable and relatively simple/easy to work on.  With the 250 hp, this boat can defiantly fly!
