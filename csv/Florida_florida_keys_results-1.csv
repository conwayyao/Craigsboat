16,new,[],2016-12-20 12:31,"NEW, NEVER LAUNCHED The Mitzi 16 is a sponson type boat hull in which the transom extends around the outboard. This configuration allows the boat to have a great hole shot where the transom of the boat does not want to dig down, allowing the boat to hop on plane in shallower water and quicker. The sponsons also put buoyancy past the outboard to keep the draft shallower overall. The 16CC has a huge amount of storage, in the 3 rear hatches and under the front deck ~ more than most skiffs of the size. A large front casting deck makes this skiff the fly fishermans dream or the spin fisherman who likes a lot of room to work, and play fish.

He lived in Missouri and purchased the boat to use in Florida during the winter months. He used it the following winter then his illness with emphysema became more severe limiting his time to use it. I'll give you a brief history: In 2008 and 2009 the boat was used very little (only in the winter months October-March). Then in 2010 it wasn't used at all. 2011 it was used lightly again this time in the summer months in Missouri. In 2012 and 2013 used very little. Getting in and out of the water was too much for him handle. 2014 he passed away and since that time it's been in possession. I used it three times since then but due to living around salt water only I stopped using it at all and has been in the trailer since.  The boat doesn't have a Hobbs meter but I'd estimate the boat has less than 100 hours on it. This boat has never been used in a tournament, and literally has only had the livewell used a few times. The boat has been regularly serviced and has been maintained extremely well -- wiped down after each use and waxed regularly. Carpets were just recently cleaned, and look almost new. The boat has an amazing layout with no wasted space inside and plenty of leg room at the console for the 6 footers. The front bow consists of three large locking dry storage areas, each lid has upgraded gas springs which is usually found only on bigger more expensive rigs. Two of the compartments serve as rod lockers, each with rod organizers and rod tubes to separate the tips. I can easily store in upwards of 20 rods in this boat without a hassle, including rods up to 8'. Not many boats in this class can say that. It also has a third storage compartment at the bow that can house an entire fleet of tackle and equipment. These compartments are super dry, never have condensation or water inside even in the harshest weather. The boat is tournament ready, with a full size divided  livewell with automatic timer and recirculation options. This boat handles rough water very well, and is extremely stable and well built. I feel this is one of the best fishing platforms for its size and money. Another nice feature is a slot in the floor next to the console for a third pedestal seat in case you're taking the family fishing. This boat is flawless, the motor starts on the first turn every time and runs strong. I can get 42-45 with a full load and two adults. This engine is great for the fisherman on a budget. It will save you at both the pump and doesn't burn oil. The boat is super clean, and the motor has been filled with Ethanol Free Gas Can't say enough about the boat, it will be a great rig for years to come. Email me for more pictures.

Motor is a running Atomic 4 gas motor.  I does need some adjustment with the idle and the shifter and throttle need some work.  Not Major however. Includes a great sail and jib. No tears or damage.  Mast is a through style mast and adds great response and stability. Head is marine approved with top side pump out. 10' Beam. 4.5 draft.  V-birth has great storage.  Mattress is a memory foam and very comfortable.  Port holes fully functional with no leaks.  Working water heater and water pump.  Clean tank.  Various storage compartments.  Door to Head also serves as privacy door to V-birth.  Sleeps 5 comfortably.  New Pyle 12V stereo with 4 speakers.   Alcohol two burner stove that works great. In and out Refrigerator that does need a new temp control gauge.  2-12V outlets with volt display. Working Navigation GPS unit a Lowrance Globemap 5200. Vhf/Uhf radio is a Standard horizon Quest-X GX1500S. 12v V-birth lighting.  Working solar.  Lights all function.  Auto-pilot.  Low profile Bimini that will need new canvas. Battery bank has 3 batteries that work currently but may need replacing.  Working bilge. Plenty of storage in the rear quarter birth area.  Roomy.  Full 110 hook-up with shore cord.  All 110 outlets work.  Head has working shower head and sink.  Topside paint could use some work. and woodwork on topside can be refinished.  Solid keel so no messing with a centerboard.  All lines in great shape. Complete safety line. Two anchors. Again, this is a sound and clean boat.  I have lived on this boat for the past year, on the hook, on the ball and in a slip.  I have had no issues with her.  She sails perfectly.  I is tough to sell her however I'm upgrading due to family size.
