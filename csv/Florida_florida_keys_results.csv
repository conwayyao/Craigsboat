30,fair,,2016-12-18 13:11,"EMERGENCY DISTRESS SALE!!! 6,000 OBO AS IS We are in the process of an urgent move and under a MASSIVE time crunch, which is reflected in our asking price. Le Pecheur De'Toilles (Fisherman of the Stars) is 60' long with a 17.5 foot beam and a 7.5 foot draft. Built in 1955, in Nova Scotia, as a North Atlantic fishing trawler, she was converted for private use in the late 60's. She has 11 layers of fiberglass laid over her oak hull. She has a 1933 (older than the boat!) 6 cylinder Caterpillar diesel engine, that starts and runs like a champ every time we've tried, and qualifies her for vintage vessel registration. There is a problem with the transmission, work will need to be done to get her self propelled again but there is room to put an outboard on back as an option or in the interim.  She has new starter batteries (may need to be charged, not sure), 1,000 gallon fuel tank, 700 gallon fresh water tank, new water pump, water-maker (membranes need pickling), and electric windlass with new batteries. On board diesel generator needs new alternator and fresh water pump (around $700 from Marathon Diesel). Below deck are the main living quarters: The large V-birth has 4 bunks, 2 full length closets and a curtain that separates it from the bunk area directly aft.  Centerline is an open communal area with a double-wide bunk on either side, both with a privacy curtain and storage underneath. Amidships is a grand salon. U-shaped settees, perfect for lounging, are on the port-side and a table with benches, desk and a freezer (compressor needs work) on starboard. Aft of the saloon there is a head with a shower on starboard, and the master stateroom, with drawers, hanging storage and storage under the bed, on port. Further aft is the sizable engine room and 'crawl-in' lazarette. These are both only accessible from the pilot-house. The deck is flat and massive, perfect to play fetch with the dogs or host raucous pirate parties. There is a sampson post a few feet from the bow, just forward of the electric windlass. Aft is a massive hatch that floods the bunk area with light below, when not covered so lazy pirates can sleep in. Aft of that is the forward mast. Amidships is the companionway door. Our favorite place to star-gaze is from the hammock strung between the mast and companionway.  Between the companionway and the wheel-house/galley/full head, is a large open area with a giant alfresco table and propane grill. The raised wheel-house is centerline, accessible through the galley, whose door is port of the wheel-house. The galley has plenty of seating, large table, full propane oven, large top-loading fridge (compressor needs work) mini-fridge/freezer, microwave, double sink and lots of storage. Stairs down to the engine room and lazarette are just inside the galley door. Engine room has the space for an additional stateroom (In it's past was used as Captain's quarter's) Starboard of the wheel-house/galley is another full head, with composting toilet. She is jam-packed with character and personality! People admire and comment on her daily. She has the potential to be an excellent investment vessel; You could make a killing in Key West with sunset sails, for example. Formerly, she hosted an Outward Bound type program in the Bahamas, for about 17 years. Or, you can just embrace the Pirate-Life, like we have. We have lived aboard with our family of 5, 2 dogs, and 2 cats comfortably, for quite a while. She needs some love, for sure, but most importantly, her hull is sound. I like to say that she is a Home-Depot boat, not a Westmarine boat, which makes repairs and upgrades much more affordable. Fixed up and with a patient seller, she could easily demand $100K(+) Contact my husband John by phone @ show contact info",,5924323725,,60,,Pirate ship,,,$6000,sail, (Marathon),60ft Motor Sailer/Pirateship,https://keys.craigslist.org/boa/5924323725.html,1955
