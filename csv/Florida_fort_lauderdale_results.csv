35,,,2016-12-18 19:39,"The Boat 2007 Custom Gheenoe LT15 with Raptor Stick Steering Setup. The boat has a false floor/storage compartment running from the front of the live well to the front deck. The live well is in working order and can be used as additional storage if you're not a live-baiter. The front of the boat is a casting deck/battery storage compartment for the Group 27 (accessories) and Group 24 batteries (dedicated to starting the motor). Structurally and cosmetically the boat is in great shape. One issue that you should be aware of is that a small amount of water ends up in the bilge area when the boat is in the water. It could be as simple as buying a new plug that fits tighter or as ""difficult"" as re-sealing the live-well pickup, transducer mount, or jackplate bolts. Certainly an easy fix, I just do not have the time and am not all that handy. The Motor 2007 Mercury 30hp 4 Stroke EFI. Motor has power trim and tilt (recently replaced) and is electric start with an a pull-start backup. It is in pristine shape under the cowling, with no corrosion, and runs and starts like a top. Flushed after saltwater use and run on non-ethanol since I've owned it. Trailer is a Continental in good shape. Recently added guide-ons. The lights work. Accessories Motorguide R3-saltwater grade. I'm not sure if its the 55 or 45 lbs/thrust, but I can say that it pushes the boat fine in a stiff wind or current. Bob's Machine Shop Hydraulic Jackplate-not currently working. The jackplate was working when I purchased the boat. I had a mechanic friend get it back in working order by tinkering with the wiring harness but it is not working again. If you are handy you will have it working in no time. Lowrance HDS 4 JBL Headunit and Jensen Speakers with auxiliary/usb input 2 Bilge Pumps-- one 1100gph wired to a float switch and one 360 gph. The 360 came with the boat and I added the 1100 and float switch just in case. Both have a manual ""on/off"" switch. Push Pole, don't think it's a brand name but it gets the job done. SeaDek on poling platform and driver's seat I bought the boat and was planning on catching every fish that swims in Flamingo with it. I have not had the time to use it and would like to see it put to good use. I am asking $5600 or best reasonable offer. I have a clear title and registration in hand for the boat, and the trailer is registered. My name is Chris; call, text, or email me if you have any questions.

During full service brand new Gairmin 74dv was installed this has new downvu technology, (2) 10"" JL AUDIO subs, (4) 6.5 speakers, and 2 tweeters powered by 2 JL audio amps. i also had a brand new ladder mounted,brand new lenco trim tabs, and a brand new 8ft power pole.
