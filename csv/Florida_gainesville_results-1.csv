26,excellent,"['24.727900', '-81.038600']",2016-12-19 18:15,"Asking Price $16500 Ranger up for sale - boat was purchased new in 2007 by my Father. He lived in Missouri and purchased the boat to use in Florida during the winter months. He used it the following winter then his illness with emphysema became more severe limiting his time to use it. I'll give you a brief history: In 2008 and 2009 the boat was used very little (only in the winter months October-March). Then in 2010 it wasn't used at all. 2011 it was used lightly again this time in the summer months in Missouri. In 2012 and 2013 used very little. Getting in and out of the water was too much for him handle. 2014 he passed away and since that time it's been in possession. I used it three times since then but due to living around salt water only I stopped using it at all and has been in the trailer since. The boat doesn't have a Hobbs meter but I'd estimate the boat has less than 100 hours on it. This boat has never been used in a tournament, and literally has only had the livewell used a few times. The boat has been regularly serviced and has been maintained extremely well -- wiped down after each use and waxed regularly. Carpets were just recently cleaned, and look almost new. The boat has an amazing layout with no wasted space inside and plenty of leg room at the console for the 6 footers. The front bow consists of three large locking dry storage areas, each lid has upgraded gas springs which is usually found only on bigger more expensive rigs. Two of the compartments serve as rod lockers, each with rod organizers and rod tubes to separate the tips. I can easily store in upwards of 20 rods in this boat without a hassle, including rods up to 8'. Not many boats in this class can say that. It also has a third storage compartment at the bow that can house an entire fleet of tackle and equipment. These compartments are super dry, never have condensation or water inside even in the harshest weather. The boat is tournament ready, with a full size divided livewell with automatic timer and recirculation options. This boat handles rough water very well, and is extremely stable and well built. I feel this is one of the best fishing platforms for its size and money. Another nice feature is a slot in the floor next to the console for a third pedestal seat in case you're taking the family fishing. This boat is flawless, the motor starts on the first turn every time and runs strong. I can get 42-45 with a full load and two adults. This engine is great for the fisherman on a budget. It will save you at both the pump and doesn't burn oil. The boat is super clean, and the motor has been filled with Ethanol Free Gas Can't say enough about the boat, it will be a great rig for years to come. Email me for more pictures.

It has splatter paint inside which makes it very easy to clean, care for and live with. Keep in mind this is a used boat so there are the expected used boat issues.  No, its not perfect cosmetically.  Yes, everything works as far as I can tell but that could change next week.  There are four removable seats, bimini top, poling platform.
