This is a bullet proof motor. search craigslist for a 25hp mercury and you will see. Boat does 20-26mph  with one person.It has a center console with front seat and side mount quicksilver controls with ignition key and working brand new push key choke SOLENOID. Brand New steering wheel that I will include with it, still in the box. It has a Mercury Vengeance stainless steel prop(google them they are very pricey) I will include a spare stainless vengeance prop for $80 both are like new ,new complete  carb rebuild with  all new mercury internals (I have every part that has been removed still in a container for inspection. I even kept the old fuel filter for under the cowl for a spare) New fuel floats and jets,  New spark plugs,new under cowl fuel filter, all new fuel lines (from the carb to the new attwood tank and primer bowl, I have a 6 gallon or a 12 gallon tank, you choose, new water separater with new filter never installed, and new stainless mounting hardware included. No leaks in entire fuel system.High pressure stainless crimps for entire fuel system DO NOT REGULAR SCREW HOSE CLAMPS they will cut hoses and rust. brand new Hydro foil, new water pump, new gear oil (I have a pressure tester to check motor and lower unit if you would like) New mercury Starter bobs machine shop manual jack plate that will fit over a 150hp motor with solid 1"" aluminum plate on inside of transom to give extra strength. All stainless 1/2"" stainless bolts washers and nuts. $250 new without mounting hardware or 1"" plate. New deep cell rv battery with a really nice battery box with digital readout and two cig lighters purchased both this year. new Garelick single step swim ladder for scalloping installed with all stainless hardware and 5200 3m marine sealant I will even include a Lowrance gps chart plotter down scan imaging elite HDI 5 with the combo sonar and down scan imaging transducer with water temp and cover and quick release mount, so unit can be stored inside when not in use or during off season, compatible with navionics + chip.look it up its around $400-$500 for it alone It would have to be installed. But I will include all stainless hardware to mount and even help with install on a Monday or Tuesday when I'm off, will only take a few min to set up or I will plug it up to show it works. If you don't have the time for install. I will also throw in a new coleman xtream cooler for a seat purchased this last season and new  plastic cooler mounts and tie downs  still in the packaging. I also installed two new garboard drains below the deck to make sure there is no trapped water under the deck ( make sure any older carolina skiff has these) The Boat has a Current registration and clear open Title in my name. I will even ride to the tag office with you to put it in your name in Bronson. I will show you the carolina skiff numbers that match the title that are stamped into the hull during manufacture.I will also include a new in box battery operated adhesive stick rpm digital gauge and hour counter for under the cowl. I also have the actual mercury shop Manuel that has full pictures for just the 25hp motor. not like the other manuals with 30 different motors mixed together. Very easy to do anything to this motor with this book. The Trailer is really nice with led lighting and tag that is mounted above the water on the top of the pvc guide posts. This way your lights will new get submerged. All connections are high and dry with double insulated 12 gauge wire. It has a current clean and clear registration tagged to next year It is a solid aluminum trailer with NEW BUDY BEARINGs  and BRAND NEW TIRES with 200 miles on them (no dry rot). I will include a good spare rim and tire (even though you wont need it) and a new bracket to mount it to the front of the trailer. it has a brand new HD 2000lbs winch with new black strap and hook. It also has a brand new double wheel 2000lbs flip jack. Both way over boat raiting. I would say the boat motor console and all gear with full cooler and full of gas is under 750lbs. I used my acura rsx 4cyl 2.0 to pull it. So if you have a car you can get uhaul to install the wiring and hitch and still not be over half your towing capacity with this boat and trailer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The bad is it needs a fresh layer of gell coat or awlgrip on the inside and a little  high gloss paint on the outside. I repaired every gell coat crack in the entire boat and  rebuilt and fiber glassed the front deck.(it is sealed with two water tight hatches for a large dry box)  I used it as is and it never bothered me. This boat floats in 6 inches of water and will need nothing through this next year.  Just needs to be started once every few months to keep carbs clean. I always used marine stable and sea foam in every tank. This motor is super clean and nothing is broken or missing. I will take $1300 for the motor controls all cables and and stainless prop (keep in mind without the jack plate this is a 20"" shaft. I will also throw in one prop and a stick steer setup if wanted fr this price $300 for the  lowrance HDI with transducer,all mounts including the quick release console mount and snap on screen cover, with new stainless  hardware obo $1400  for the boat, trailer, console, and jack plate   This is the DLX with high side walls, not a J series I also will let the stick steer setup go for $50 Attwood tanks 6 gallon $20 12 gallon $50 with fuel gauge If purchased all together for $2500 I will throw in some vests a anchor with line a personal flotation device and a plano dry box to keep your other coast guard required items dry I'm a motivated seller and will separate other parts The only reason I'm selling is because I just finished a restoration of  a 1981 17' mako angler WITH A 115HP YAMAHA . I have no reason for two boats. I can spray gelcoat on the inside and paint the outside with marine high gloss enamel for $300-$800 depending on how much sanding and finishing you want done. Or you can do it yourself and save the money. And she will look brand new.

Fish box and dry storage boxes. Spare tire and disc brakes on fully welded aluminum road king torsion-axle trailer. This boat easily cruises between 30 and 40 mph.

I purchased her in 2006 in Minnesota from the estate of the first owner,  based on the criteria described above.  I would say it had been lightly used and stored well. She is Seafoam Green with an off white deck, white sails with a grey bottom paint and canvas. The gelcoat on the hull still has its unwaxed sheen in many places.   Except for 3 Cedar key and Chesapeake Bay cruises this is a fresh water boat. While fast, she is not not the fastest Trailer Tri, but she is the fastest trailer to sailing trimaran design due to her features of unstayed masts (yes 2 of them but no wires to hold them up) and her hinged out riggers(no pins or bolts) fold em out, fold them in, on the trailer or in the water. The sails are vertical battened so that they are reefed, furled and stored wrapped around the mast, each of which has a full length cover for storage and transport. I would rate their shape and drawing power as good to very good. She has an extra main and mizzen, verticle battens but with UV damage and repairs, functional but not pretty. It has the anchor kit with cast bronze deck fittings for the 11lb claw, stored on the bow; removable navagation light kit on a 12 v. battery, switches and accessory plug. The motormount is on the rudder with a 2hp Honda 4 stroke. It comes with a tonneau cover for the fore cockpit. It has custom designed and built wing mounted dodgers, on stainless steel frames. These clam shell up for a 'Birdwatcher' style cabin, the full length 'hatchway' being enclosed by musquito netting or a battened awning. When raised it encloses the wings and forward cockpit. This creates a large, protected living space with standing headroom under the awning and allows for using the wings for storage, clearing the whole center cockpit for camp space. When lowered the dodgers store covered on the outer edges of the wings. See the pictures in the photo section. She rides on a galvanized Continental tilt, bunk trailer.  While the trailer is equipped with bearing buddies she can be launched and retrieved without putting the hubs under water at most ramps. While this boat is prized by experienced sailers because of the criteria I began with, she is a very good beginners boat, especially if young children are along.  I'm retired, and enjoy traveling so I can deliver her anywhere in the country at very favorable rates.",50,5911519953,43.054402,21,-89.391804,Sea Pearl,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@43.054402,-89.391804,16z",Sea Pearl Tri,$13000,sail, (Madison Wi),Trailer Trimaran - SeaPearl -,https://gainesville.craigslist.org/boa/5911519953.html,1999

59,excellent,"['24.727900', '-81.038600']",2016-12-08 16:20,"Asking Price $16500 Ranger up for sale - boat was purchased new in 2007 by my Father. He lived in Missouri and purchased the boat to use in Florida during the winter months. He used it the following winter then his illness with emphysema became more severe limiting his time to use it. I'll give you a brief history: In 2008 and 2009 the boat was used very little (only in the winter months October-March). Then in 2010 it wasn't used at all. 2011 it was used lightly again this time in the summer months in Missouri. In 2012 and 2013 used very little. Getting in and out of the water was too much for him handle. 2014 he passed away and since that time it's been in possession. I used it three times since then but due to living around salt water only I stopped using it at all and has been in the trailer since. The boat doesn't have a Hobbs meter but I'd estimate the boat has less than 100 hours on it. This boat has never been used in a tournament, and literally has only had the livewell used a few times. The boat has been regularly serviced and has been maintained extremely well -- wiped down after each use and waxed regularly. Carpets were just recently cleaned, and look almost new. The boat has an amazing layout with no wasted space inside and plenty of leg room at the console for the 6 footers. The front bow consists of three large locking dry storage areas, each lid has upgraded gas springs which is usually found only on bigger more expensive rigs. Two of the compartments serve as rod lockers, each with rod organizers and rod tubes to separate the tips. I can easily store in upwards of 20 rods in this boat without a hassle, including rods up to 8'. Not many boats in this class can say that. It also has a third storage compartment at the bow that can house an entire fleet of tackle and equipment. These compartments are super dry, never have condensation or water inside even in the harshest weather. The boat is tournament ready, with a full size divided livewell with automatic timer and recirculation options. This boat handles rough water very well, and is extremely stable and well built. I feel this is one of the best fishing platforms for its size and money. Another nice feature is a slot in the floor next to the console for a third pedestal seat in case you're taking the family fishing. This boat is flawless, the motor starts on the first turn every time and runs strong. I can get 42-45 with a full load and two adults. This engine is great for the fisherman on a budget. It will save you at both the pump and doesn't burn oil. The boat is super clean, and the motor has been filled with Ethanol Free Gas Can't say enough about the boat, it will be a great rig for years to come. Email me for more pictures.
