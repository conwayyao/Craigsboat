He lived in Missouri and purchased the boat to use in Florida during the winter months. He used it the following winter then his illness with emphysema became more severe limiting his time to use it. I'll give you a brief history: In 2008 and 2009 the boat was used very little (only in the winter months October-March). Then in 2010 it wasn't used at all. 2011 it was used lightly again this time in the summer months in Missouri. In 2012 and 2013 used very little. Getting in and out of the water was too much for him handle. 2014 he passed away and since that time it's been in possession. I used it three times since then but due to living around salt water only I stopped using it at all and has been in the trailer since. The boat doesn't have a Hobbs meter but I'd estimate the boat has less than 100 hours on it. This boat has never been used in a tournament, and literally has only had the livewell used a few times. The boat has been regularly serviced and has been maintained extremely well -- wiped down after each use and waxed regularly. Carpets were just recently cleaned, and look almost new. The boat has an amazing layout with no wasted space inside and plenty of leg room at the console for the 6 footers. The front bow consists of three large locking dry storage areas, each lid has upgraded gas springs which is usually found only on bigger more expensive rigs. Two of the compartments serve as rod lockers, each with rod organizers and rod tubes to separate the tips. I can easily store in upwards of 20 rods in this boat without a hassle, including rods up to 8'. Not many boats in this class can say that. It also has a third storage compartment at the bow that can house an entire fleet of tackle and equipment. These compartments are super dry, never have condensation or water inside even in the harshest weather. The boat is tournament ready, with a full size divided livewell with automatic timer and recirculation options. This boat handles rough water very well, and is extremely stable and well built. I feel this is one of the best fishing platforms for its size and money. Another nice feature is a slot in the floor next to the console for a third pedestal seat in case you're taking the family fishing. This boat is flawless, the motor starts on the first turn every time and runs strong. I can get 42-45 with a full load and two adults. This engine is great for the fisherman on a budget. It will save you at both the pump and doesn't burn oil. The boat is super clean, and the motor has been filled with Ethanol Free Gas Can't say enough about the boat, it will be a great rig for years to come. Email me for more pictures.

70,good,[],2016-11-29 10:13,"Selling my 1989 Malibu Euro F3 Skier with trailer. I am selling the boat because my kids are getting older and want to fish more. It has 933 hours on it, I purchased it with 650 hours in 2011. This boat is ready for the lake and is still used weekly as we live on a lake here in Central Florida. For those who are looking for an affordable, reliable ski boat for your family, this boat is ready to go. The floor is solid with no soft spots anywhere, interior has some wear and tear as you can see in the pictures. Ski platform is solid and gets re oiled every spring. It has a 5.3 Mercruiser 350 HO with a Holley Marine 650 double pumper carb and aftermarket intake. I updated the distributor to a Mallory HEI electronic ignition and Flame Thrower coil to replace old points style distributor. New parts since I purchased: Alternator, Fuel Pump, Starter, complete fuel line replacement, fuel sending unit in tank after removing tank and flushing, both rudder and shaft packing, rebuilt throttle and shift drive unit, all gauges other than original Air Guide Speedometers (Fully Functional), speedometer pick ups, raw water pump, Pyle Marine amp (Aux input only no head unit and four speakers (Three speakers working, one not), Depth/Fish Finder, Bilge Pump, Dual Battery switch. All lights working, gauges all work with back lights, original Air Guide Speedometers work (Two Side By Side). Oil Changes every spring, non ethanol fuel for performance . Not sure if I missed anything but as you can see I have continued to maintain the boat simply because we ski ALOT! Boat is of no use if it doesn't perform as we need it to. What is could use: Windshield seal replaced ( I have the rubber seal that goes on both sides of window just hasn't bothered me enough to install it), good buffing job by a professional to bring the gel coat back out, its a little dull although we keep it on our lift and covered. As mentioned above the interior is showing its age but again looks have not bothered me enough to get it redone because the boat runs extremely well and we are more concerned with performance than looks at this point. Not sure what else I can add other than this boat was used today and will continue to be used until sold. Its ready for the water. Trailer is solid, wheel bearings were repacked last summer as we pulled it to Mt. Dora to ski. I will include the spare I have for the trailer and the cover i use to cover the boat. I am willing to demo the boat anytime for serious buyers. I have clear title.
