The Hatteras 58 Yacht Fisherman is essentially a 53 Motor Yacht with the addition of a 5-foot cockpit extension. She was introduced in 1970, just a year after the Hatteras 53 MY was launched, and she enjoyed a long and very successful production run during the next twelve years. The 58's cockpit makes her a more versatile and better handling boat than the 53 MY, and the additional fuel capacity results in a GREATER CRUISING RANGE. Belowdecks, her three-stateroom, galley-down floorplan is the same as the 53MY with the helm open to the salon and separate walk-in engine rooms. The Aft deck is sheltered by a bridge overhang and fitted with wing doors for wind and spray protection. She is powered with the Detroit Diesel 8V-71TI's which cruise at 16-17 knots. Still a popular yacht in spite of her age, resale values remain quite strong.",1255,5898265663,,58,,Hatteras,https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%31%30%30%30+US+Highway+%39%38+Carrabelle%2C+FL+US,58 Yacht Fisherman,$199000,power," (Carrabelle, Fl)",1973 Hatteras 58 Yacht Fisherman,https://jacksonville.craigslist.org/boa/5898265663.html,1973

It was rigged with a 2007 Mercury 150 Optimax which currently has 360 hours and was recently serviced with a new oil pump installed and given a clean bill of health. I cruise at 4000 rpm at 30mph. The boat was just repainted Seafoam Green in December 2015. Also new within the last 6 months is the trolling motor (motor guide XI5), the Simrad GO7 chart plotter/fishfinder with navionics . I recently re-plumbed the live well adding a 1600 gph pump and new 1 1/8 flex hose. The front casting platform has three hatches, the middle hatch has a cast net bucket inside to keep your net out of the way while fishing.
