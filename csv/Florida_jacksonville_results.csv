At first glance the Triumph 215 CC looks like a garden-variety center console fishboat, but get up close and you'll find there's something different about her: This 22' (6.71 m) outboard isn't made out of fiberglass, nor aluminum. She's built of Roplene, and the company says that makes her the World's Toughest Boat. Triumph's 215CC is a proven seaworthy deep V hull design and is NMMA certified. The hull is indestructible, made of roto moulded roplene. Very low maintenance - no gel coat to chip, beaching or hitting the rocks will not hurt this boat. It has a great ride, very dry and smooth in the chop, with a 19 degree dead rise. She has new upholstery, underwater LED lighting, marine AM/FM/CD stereo, hardtop, 5 below deck hatches, self bailing deck, wash down, bait well, courtesy lights, 3 batteries and 60 gal fuel cap. Duel axel trailer with 4 new tires and a spare. boat has a 2 stroke 150 Mercury outboard oil and fuel injected. This baby will not leave you without major power! She is great for the ocean or just tooling in the waterways or barrier islands.

98,,,2016-12-18 07:24,"I have up for sale in awesome condition my 1993-94   30' Proline with twin 225 Evinrude's  up for sale. (Motors are both 1997's). She is being pulled by a triple axle aluminum trailer. This boat is AWESOME and HUGE standing at 30' long and an amazing beam width of 10'.  Please note pictures do this boat NO JUSTICE of real size or beauty.  She Holds up to 12 people and runs 55Mph and has a 200 gallon gas tank.  Fully equipped with working transom live well , twin bilge pumps, wash down, 30gallon fresh water tank and VHF radio.  Only thing that needs replaced is the Lowrance head unit.  Also has a step down inside and  under the center console that you can use as a bathroom but We use it as storage instead. One of my favorite things about the boat is the nice twin outboard bracket that you can Fish and walk on outside the boat. The bracket it self is holding 450Hp on the back giving the boat a great hull shot along with top end. Another one of my favorites and probably the nicest thing to have is never having to throw out or pull back in an anchor EVER AGAIN. All That is done with a push of a button with this nice Windless anchor.  One push drops the anchor and another push of the button  pulls her back in.  Also included is 2 - 15' out riggers which including the beam of the boat throws out about a 50Ft spread when trolling.  When trolling we usually run 7-8 lines including the riggers.  If your looking for a great off shore boat that handles waves great and is a fishing machine then look NO further.  This is a turn key boat ready to go.  Motors are always flushed and have always been serviced. Boat was just detailed and polished. Clean and clear title Please call or text anytime day or night. show contact info",,5911543019,,30,,,,,$20000,power, (Polk),@@@ 30' OFFSHORE / 10' BEAM / Proline,https://jacksonville.craigslist.org/boa/5911543019.html,
