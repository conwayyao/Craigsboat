Current Ohio Registration. Hand Laid Hull with cloth and roving in isothalic resin. Varnished Mahogany Gunnels and nose pieces. Positive seal scupper hole with lock out. Hull weight only 70lb with positive sealed flotation in the bow and stern compartments. Length: 15 ft 9 inches. Beam 37"" at shear, 18"" at waterline. Draft 4"". Two rowing trim positions, 2 cane passenger seats. Sliding seat has quick removable padding over wood. Retail is $5430 new, ordered in advance, excluding freight. Excellent for cross training, the Guideboat 15 will row all day at 5 mph easy, 6 to 7 mph with moderate exertion, and 8 to 10 mph at race pace by seasoned scullers. This Guideboat design has covered the 65 mile round trip Lake George to Ticonderoga distance in record time consistently over the last six years, making the 65 mi run in less than 12 hours, without the sliding seat unit! As to versatility, the Guideboat 15 can carry a multitude of gear and people very efficiently in calm or rough water conditions. Unlike racing shells the Guideboat 15 will row right through motorboat wakes, wind chop and small surf. This hull is among the driest of all rowboats. the Guideboat 15 has one of the two fastest traditional Guideboat hull designs while also retaining a high degree of stability in the water. It is an excellent training boat, fishing boat, family boat or cruising boat because of it's stability. As is the case with all Guideboats the more weight that is carried the more stable they become due to their superior designed ""V"" shaped hull. It tracks beautifully without a fin and only draws a few inches of water with people and gear aboard.",,5895671164,,15,,,,,$2400,human, (central ohio),"Adirondack Guideboat 15, Custom Built, Ro-Wing, Sculling Oars",https://jacksonville.craigslist.org/boa/5895671164.html,

She is being pulled by a triple axle aluminum trailer. This boat is AWESOME and HUGE standing at 30' long and an amazing beam width of 10'.  Please note pictures do this boat NO JUSTICE of real size or beauty.  She Holds up to 12 people and runs 55Mph and has a 200 gallon gas tank.  Fully equipped with working transom live well , twin bilge pumps, wash down, 30gallon fresh water tank and VHF radio.  Only thing that needs replaced is the Lowrance head unit.  Also has a step down inside and  under the center console that you can use as a bathroom but We use it as storage instead. One of my favorite things about the boat is the nice twin outboard bracket that you can Fish and walk on outside the boat. The bracket it self is holding 450Hp on the back giving the boat a great hull shot along with top end. Another one of my favorites and probably the nicest thing to have is never having to throw out or pull back in an anchor EVER AGAIN. All That is done with a push of a button with this nice Windless anchor.  One push drops the anchor and another push of the button  pulls her back in.  Also included is 2 - 15' out riggers which including the beam of the boat throws out about a 50Ft spread when trolling.  When trolling we usually run 7-8 lines including the riggers.  If your looking for a great off shore boat that handles waves great and is a fishing machine then look NO further.  This is a turn key boat ready to go.

Nick and Pete Stamas of Tarpon Springs learned the traditional craft in the 1930s, then made the bold move to fiberglass in the 1950s. Today, the Stamas plant is still in Tarpon Springs, and the family builder is still turning out well-designed, well-built boats in a variety of models (12 at the time of this writing) from about 29 to 40 feet LOA.",600,5872903995,30.348000,25,-81.588200,Stamas,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@30.348000,-81.588200,16z",255 family fish,$22000,power, (Arlington),1990 Stamas 25 Ft - family fish,https://jacksonville.craigslist.org/boa/5872903995.html,1990

Completely restored and documented in 2007/2008 from the stringers up with all composite materials by Bateau2.  https://boatbuildercentral.wordpress.com/2015/10/29/an-in-depth-rebuild-of-a-classic-aquasport-22-flatback/ During the restoration the stringers were replaced with solid core material, the transom was enclosed and a porta bracket was added. It was rigged with a 2007 Mercury 150 Optimax which currently has 360 hours and was recently serviced with a new oil pump installed and given a clean bill of health. I cruise at 4000 rpm at 30mph. The boat was just repainted Seafoam Green in December 2015. Also new within the last 6 months is the trolling motor (motor guide XI5), the Simrad GO7 chart plotter/fishfinder with navionics . I recently re-plumbed the live well adding a 1600 gph pump and new 1 1/8 flex hose. The front casting platform has three hatches, the middle hatch has a cast net bucket inside to keep your net out of the way while fishing. There is so much more to this boat but talking about it does not do it justice. A lot of money has gone into this classic boat and to restore one like this would cost a lot more than the asking price. I am including the aluminum trailer which is perfectly fit for the boat and pulls great. Please feel free to email or text any questions, phone calls are difficult to answer during the day but text and email I can reply quickly. If necessary I can call you in the evenings. The boat is titled and I do have the clean title in hand. Update: I have been flooded with questions on the boat so I decided to list out some of the other items on the boat.
