99,,,2016-12-17 20:00,"Awesome skiff for sale. Great for the flats, lakes, and bays. Runs super shallow due to how wide it is (8' wide). The weight displacement creates the very low draft so no worries getting into those skinny areas in this. You can literally pitch a three man tent between the console and front deck as well. These boats are made in Old Town, FL. Here's the details: -2012 Catch 19' Skiff -8' wide -2012 aluminim trailer -2001 90 Yamaha 2 stroke that runs like a champ and pees like a racehorse -Brand new steering wheel and throttle box -22 gallon fuel tank -Livewell -Bilge pump -Blue deck lights for night -Running lights -Shallow water anchor mount -New Trailer guide-on posts -New spare tire and mount -Also have a bimini top for it in my shed, it is black, no tears Boat is ready to fish today, needs no work, nothing at all. The push pole does not come with the boat, but just FYI, this boat is awesome to pole.  I had a flats boat with a poling platform for years.  I would pole for miles on Everglades trips and several hundred yards in Tampa Bay.  As surprising as it is being a 19' skiff, 8' wide, this thing is fun to pole.  You can literally stand on the corner of the rear deck and because the boat is so wide it doesn't lean at all.  I call it the mini-barge, the room is awesome being able to actually walk around an awesome fishing platform like this.  Running and poling this boat makes me feel like I'm on a badass barebones skiff in South America. The hull is worth $7,800. The trailer is worth $2,000. The motor is with $2,700. You're already getting $500 below cost, so no low offers will be considered. If you saw this at a dealership it would be listed at at least $13-13,500. Plus dealer fees, taxes, etc. Im in no rush to sell it, simply restoring an old boat and won't need this one anymore pretty soon. For serious buyers Im happy to do a wet test at a nearby lake. Would make a great tower boat, commercial boat, charter boat, mullet boat, flats boat, spec boat, crappie boat, as it is a work horse. Boat is very similar to a carolina skiff but has lower side walls thus reducing the weight and giving it a cleaner more low profile appearance.
