Zippered T-Top canvas allows rider to ""pop up top"" with padded seat for a great fish spotting vantage point. Engine runs flawlessly. Has almost new battery. 1998 hull is VERY SOLID and SOUND. This is a rare opportunity to have great performance with a newer four-stroke engine without paying thousands for a newer hull (when this one functions just as good).

This boat spent its entire life around the Washington, D.C. area (still has a 2013 Potomac River fishing decal). This Steiger Craft has always been a private/pleasure use vessel and appears to have been stored on a trailer inside its entire life. It never had bottom paint until I had it professionally done within the year. The extensive canvas is a full enclosure of Sunbrella fabric and is recently done and still like new. The 130 Mercury is dependable and has had a recent rebuild and the Bravo II out drive has been recently redone for complete dependability. There are new cushions in the cabin and a Garmin GPS is mounted as is a separate Garmin depth/fish finder. Has bowsprit with anchor. Included is an excellent Shoreline tandem axle trailer that is equipped with rollers for easy loading. If you are unfamiliar with Block Island boats, check them out online. They are a heavy duty vessel that are classic designed. Recent engine and out drive rebuild offers years of dependable service. This boat is beautiful, rugged, unique and dependable with an outstanding heritage. It is still produced because it is a great boat--maybe last one you will ever need because of the lifetime hull guarantee from the manufacturer. It is a 1998 and looks almost identical to current production Block Islands. If my Block Island Steiger Craft might be for you, just reply to this posting and I will be in touch.

The Hatteras 58 Yacht Fisherman is essentially a 53 Motor Yacht with the addition of a 5-foot cockpit extension. She was introduced in 1970, just a year after the Hatteras 53 MY was launched, and she enjoyed a long and very successful production run during the next twelve years. The 58's cockpit makes her a more versatile and better handling boat than the 53 MY, and the additional fuel capacity results in a GREATER CRUISING RANGE. Belowdecks, her three-stateroom, galley-down floorplan is the same as the 53MY with the helm open to the salon and separate walk-in engine rooms. The Aft deck is sheltered by a bridge overhang and fitted with wing doors for wind and spray protection. She is powered with the Detroit Diesel 8V-71TI's which cruise at 16-17 knots.
