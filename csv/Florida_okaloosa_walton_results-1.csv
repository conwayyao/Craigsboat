Proud to be the ultimate in power and control. It pushes the limits of what s possible in race riding through speed, agility, power, nimble and sharp handling, precise cornering, and innovative design. But its main purpose is this: to give you every possible advantage. Features May Include: Performance & Handling Adjustable Rear Sponsons An efficient design that improves cornering stability. 3-position adjustable for your skill level and riding environment: higher for a more playful freeride experience or lower for more aggressive turning. Winglet feature enhances lean angles during turning. TÂ³ Hull Innovative, multi-staged design with extreme hard and soft chines. Allows for more precise cornering, enhances lean-in, cuts water and tracks better, extremely responsive. Ergolock System: Narrow Racing Seat & Angled Footwells A narrow Racing Seat, specially Angled Footwells, and Adjustable Ergonomic Steering (A.E.S.) allow you and the machine to become one, keeping your lower body locked in and you in full control. Intake Great & Ride Plate Intake Grate delivers enhanced acceleration. Deep side rails improve your stability and handling. Ride Plate: Normally a crown surface, but now flat, our new ride plate is designed to keep the bow down for better control. High-Output Engine Provides reliable, ultra high-performance in salt and fresh water, giving you more power and efficiency. high-Performance Variable Trim System (VTS) Quickly access the Variable Trim System (VTS) on the handlebar for fine-tuned handling based on rider preference, water conditions, and number of passengers. Trim Tabs Limits aggressive bow rise and improves parallelism to water. Also increases tracking in rough water conditions and provides more tunability. Convenience Intelligent Throttle Control (ITC) Sea-Doo is the only watercraft that starts in neutral, so the engine runs without propelling the craft forward for safer dockside starts and easy, stress-free maneuverability. And because the throttle responds to an electronic signal instead of a cable, you enjoy better fuel economy and a lower operating cost. ECO Mode Automatically determines the most economical power delivery for the greatest fuel economy. Wide-Angle Adjustable Mirrors These adjustable mirrors make for better visibility and greater situational awareness. Closed-Loop Cooling System (CLCS) The industry s only Closed-Loop Cooling System (CLCS) that uses coolant instead of corrosive saltwater (and even debris) that can damage the engine",15,5920500822,30.764400,11,-86.591700,Sea Doo,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@30.764400,-86.591700,16z",RXP X 260,$10499,power,,2014 Sea Doo RXP X 260 16 hours w Trailer,https://okaloosa.craigslist.org/boa/5920500822.html,2014

I believe there is good value in this boat with a little TLC and some elbow grease it could be a nice boat for enjoying our local waterways. Down to the nitty gritty: The motor is a 50hp Suzuki DF50 with unknown hours (there is no hour meter). As of the last time I tried to work on it the engine would crank over and run fine, however it would not put power to the prop, this could one of a few issues ranging from something as simple as a shear pin/bushing to a full replacement of the lower unit (~$750) The pontoons are watertight with no holes, it was repaired sometime around 2013 to fix a couple of small leaks and has been solid since then The deck is solid, there is a custom glass bottom feature in the middle near the front seats with a beefy stainless steel welded substructure to support it, it was wired with RGB LED light strips that are likely no longer any good, but the wiring is solid and still in place. The title for the boat has been lost to the sea but the former registered owner can be available to transfer ownership at the DMV if necessary or can sign a Bill of Sale to facilitate the process The Trailer is Not Included, it is borrowed from a friend and must be returned. That said, I can deliver for the right price within a reasonable distance or we can work out an additional charge for further distances. Included with the sale is anything on the boat to include some life jackets, an anchor, and whatever other hidden treasures that may exist. I have also purchased 2 gallons of bottom paint specially designed for use on aluminum hulls (it is Sea Hawk Aluma Hawk paint), 1 gallon is silver color and the other is black for a nice 2 tone look. The paint alone is worth $170 and it is factory sealed and has been stored in a climate controlled room since it was purchased in early 2016 Best means of contact is through Craigslist e-mail system, please provide your name and phone number in you message so I know you are not a spam-bot trying to fish for my contact information. I do not need help selling this boat, and I am not in a rush to give it away, that said I won't turn down reasonable cash offers.

Thoroughly Flushed with fresh water after every trip, no exceptions. There is nothing wrong with this boat mechanically, just needs a clean up. For the model year the upholstery is in Damn good shape only 1 tear in a seat. The red paint on the hull is understandably faded but a wax would make it look brand new. Fuel and trim guages aren't wired in but I've been out all day long from cinco bayou to Tom's bayou to the end of the jetties and everywhere in between and never ran out of gas. You can fit up to 8 people in it, great for crab island and fishing.

Lots of new parts, new driveshaft, reverse cable, carbon seal kit, heavy duty wear ring & trailer tongue jack. Jet pump oil changed last week and rave valves cleaned/polished.
