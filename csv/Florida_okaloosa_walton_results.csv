I bought this as a project and have been hacking away until life told me to do something else. I need to sell this to someone who will take her where she belongs. This exact boat in mint condition is selling above $40,000. Average for this boat is low !5,000 to lower 30,000. She is powered by twin Chevy 305's with straight shafts. All controls work on both helms. No mold inside. No leaks. New batteries this summer. Comes with a triple axle trailer. No lie, I have got 4500k in the boat and 2500k in the trailer. You will not lower my price. Now for the bad. Starboard motor needs rebuilt, water line in shower has a leak, and the bottom needs sanded and repainted. The seat cushions up on the fly-bridge need replaced as well. The Bimini could stand a new one too. Some of the gauges are out but probably just loose wires. Sitting at 28 feet long and 11 feet wide, she is very stable on the water. I have the title in hand for both boat and trailer. Again, don't ask me to lower my price because I won't. I normally play the craigslist game of over pricing so I can come down but this is my bottom dollar. Will also consider payment via trade of 20 or 24 foot enclosed trailer and some cash as well. I will go over everything with you when you come to look at it. I'm not trying to rip anyone off but my plans changed and I need to clear out. Also have a 30 foot flatbed trailer I need to sell for about 1800 or will trade for a motorcycle. Tell your friends because I need to move these items. Thank you. Kevin.

Proud to be the ultimate in power and control. It pushes the limits of what s possible in race riding through speed, agility, power, nimble and sharp handling, precise cornering, and innovative design. But its main purpose is this: to give you every possible advantage. Features May Include: Performance & Handling Adjustable Rear Sponsons An efficient design that improves cornering stability. 3-position adjustable for your skill level and riding environment: higher for a more playful freeride experience or lower for more aggressive turning. Winglet feature enhances lean angles during turning. T³ Hull Innovative, multi-staged design with extreme hard and soft chines. Allows for more precise cornering, enhances lean-in, cuts water and tracks better, extremely responsive. Ergolock System: Narrow Racing Seat & Angled Footwells A narrow Racing Seat, specially Angled Footwells, and Adjustable Ergonomic Steering (A.E.S.) allow you and the machine to become one, keeping your lower body locked in and you in full control. Intake Great & Ride Plate Intake Grate delivers enhanced acceleration. Deep side rails improve your stability and handling. Ride Plate: Normally a crown surface, but now flat, our new ride plate is designed to keep the bow down for better control. High-Output Engine Provides reliable, ultra high-performance in salt and fresh water, giving you more power and efficiency. high-Performance Variable Trim System (VTS) Quickly access the Variable Trim System (VTS) on the handlebar for fine-tuned handling based on rider preference, water conditions, and number of passengers. Trim Tabs Limits aggressive bow rise and improves parallelism to water. Also increases tracking in rough water conditions and provides more tunability. Convenience Intelligent Throttle Control (ITC) Sea-Doo is the only watercraft that starts in neutral, so the engine runs without propelling the craft forward for safer dockside starts and easy, stress-free maneuverability. And because the throttle responds to an electronic signal instead of a cable, you enjoy better fuel economy and a lower operating cost. ECO Mode Automatically determines the most economical power delivery for the greatest fuel economy.

All Getaways have a floating mast bob - righting this boat is not a problem if you get a little aggressive while flying a hull, I've done it solo Getaways include a roller furler for the jib - comes in handy when you're heading in for the day or want to drift and swim The rotomolded plastic hulls are quite forgiving - unlike the fiberglass Hobie 14 or Hobie 16, these hulls won't get damaged by obstructions in the water. I'm asking $5,500 OBO. Call me today and I'll be glad to show you this little beauty!

95,good,,2016-12-14 20:13,"For sale is one Jackson Kayak Mini Tripper kids boat. It is this model: http://jacksonkayak.com/blog/kayak/mini-tripper/ This is an excellent boat for smaller children, from 6-7 years old on up. Our youngest son has outgrown it so its time to send it to a new home. We bought this yak brand new in 2012. Its in good condition. It comes with a Bending Branches Splash 200cm youth paddle to complete the set. https://bendingbranches.com/kayak-paddles/recreational/splash-kids/snap Combined I paid $550 for the kayak and paddle so this price is a great deal! Originally the kayak didn't come with a drain plug, so I added one in the stern. Helps drain it easily after a trip or a cleaning!",,5919854304,,9,,Jackson Kayak,,Mini Tripper,$250,human, (Bluewater Bay),Jackson Kayak Mini Tripper kids kayak w/paddle,https://okaloosa.craigslist.org/boa/5919854304.html,2012
