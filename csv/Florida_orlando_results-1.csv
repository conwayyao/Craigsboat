Due to the overwhelming calls here is the differences between Surfango and Mokai Surfango is a Fiberglass hull and runs 28 Mph and MSRP is $4,500 Mokai is a Plastic hull and runs 15 Mph and MSRP is $6,500 Surfango is more of a Touring type Kayak where as the Mokai is like a River Rat that you can beat on because of it being Plastic. I hope this has helped. Manufacture Description below, also watch short video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fim2KGP0LE The Adventurer GT is Surfango's take on the evolution of the Kayak. Both can be paddled, but that's hardly the point -- fire up the electric-start 9.5hp 4-stroke engine and open the hand-held throttle and you're off like a shot on your way to the 28mph top speed, which will feel very quick indeed when you're sitting low in the waves. The joystick steering is quick and responsive enough to throw you if you're not on your guard. The kayaks feature waterproof storage compartments, fishing rod holders and an on-board digital dashboard telling you your engine RPM, battery level, coolant temperature and a petrol gauge. The 2-gallon fuel tank is enough for two hours at full throttle on either version of the kayak. The Adventurer can be fitted with a skirt to keep the rider's legs reasonably dry in colder climates. The jet pump is fitted with an innovative ""weedcutter"" device to ensure no vegetation gets curled up around the shafts -- so there's no problem with using it in sea-weedy water. The engine has been selected for its smooth, quiet drive so you can take it up a quiet river without making a nuisance of yourself to other campers. Weighing in at around 130 pounds, the Adventurer GT is easy enough to transport and there's an optional beach cart if you need to move it around solo.",2,5917375826,,10,,Surfango,,Adventure,$2495,power, (Apopka),"Christmas Special, Surfango Adventurer GT Jet Kayak",https://orlando.craigslist.org/boa/5917375826.html,

Have you ever wanted to paddle up to Manatees or Dolphins? It is easier than you think. I have been Renting and Selling Canoes and Kayaks for over 10 years. The enduring look of joy on peoples faces when they take an eco tour is amazing. There are many differences between  kayaks and canoes and it is helpful for those who wish to start these water-sports to understand which is which. Before deciding which one you want, have a try in both kayak and canoe and then decide.As an experienced paddler I can show you the differences.
