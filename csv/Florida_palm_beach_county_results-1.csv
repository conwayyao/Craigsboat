The 272 Sailfish (called the 252 Sailfish in 1994, her first year of production) is a redesigned version of Grady- White's popular 25 Sailfish built from 1978 through 1993. The 272 was built on an all-new hull bottom with increased transom deadrise and--because of her new integral transom bracket/swim platform--slightly longer overall length. Now a 27-footer, the Sailfish was long one of Grady-White's best selling models thanks to her quality construction, proven openwater performance and superb fishability. A wide 9-foot, 6-inch beam provides the 272 with plenty of cockpit space as well as a spacious cabin with berths for four, galley (with standard refrigerator), enclosed head, and an athwartships berth under the helm deck. Helm visibility is excellent, and the electronics box above the instrument panel is lockable. Additional features include hydraulic trim tabs, wide, well-secured side decks, a 20-gallon transom livewell, underseat storage, transom door, cushioned fish boxes, and excellent range. A rock-solid boat engineered to the highest standards, twin 225hp Yamaha outboards top out at close to 45 knots.

86,new,"['29.018348', '-81.371098']",2016-12-20 09:08,"2016  StarGazer 31,  brand new and under construction. This is a very unique 31 foot long houseboat in that it is trailerable without a permit in ALL 50 states and Canada. This boat is being built to strict American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC) standards and will be certified to those standards by multiple independent inspections from the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA). We are also a registered US Coast Guard boat manufacturer. FEATURES The StarGazer 31 is self contained so that it can be used for extended periods of time without relying on shore power. Amazingly and intentionally, this boat has absolutely no wood anywhere in its construction. It is designed to leave a very small carbon footprint as well as being economical and practical to operate. The StarGazer 31 will be powered by a very efficient 4 stroke outboard (60hp to 115hp). All lights onboard are 12 volt LED. The boat is extremely well insulated and is air conditioned by two 5000 BTU window AC units that draw less than 4 amps each when running. These AC units take the place of those power hungry, expensive and problem prone roof ""shaker"" units. When our A/C units wear out you simply replace them with a brand new, off the shelf $130.00 unit in a matter of minutes. A decent sized refrigerator/freezer that runs on shore power, generator power or battery power is also a part of this package. The StarGazer 31 includes a custom built aluminum trailer that will allow an easy access stairway to automatically fold down from the bow of the boat to a landing platform on the tongue of the trailer. Another set of steps (with handrail) will fold down from this platform to the ground. This very innovative feature will allow the StarGazer 31 to be used as a dry camper at a campground of your choice when water usage is not an option. The two gates on the bow of the boat (one on each side), the sliding glass door, and the door to the bathroom are all ADA compliant for wheelchair access. The bathroom has a full sized residential shower (instant propane water heater) as well as a flushing toilet. There is a very efficient galley with a stainless steel sink, induction cook top (stowable) and ample counter space for food prep. Even the kitchen cabinets have no wood in them. The main living area doubles as a living space/ bedroom featuring a very nice residential couch that folds open to a queen size bed. A LED wall mounted TV with DVD player round out the main cabin area. The bow of the boat is a large 64 square foot ""porch on the water"" that contains the helm and enough room for a BBQ grill as well as a spacious seating area. Dual anchor lockers help keep the deck uncluttered and safe. CONSTRUCTION The flotation of the StarGazer 31 is extremely durable and expensive. Two 36"" rotationally molded polyethylene pontoons (minimum 3/8"" wall thickness) that are foam filled make up the foundation of this houseboat. The original design of these pontoons was for commercial barge applications but has now been refined for the recreational market. The polyethylene material is UV stabilized and is the exact same material that has been used for decades as flotation billets on commercial and residential floating dock systems. It is the perfect material for this boat as it allows for saltwater use without any possibility of corrosion. The entire superstructure of the StarGazer 31 is made of 2"" square ""heavy wall"" marine grade (6061-T6) aluminum. The walls, floor and ceiling are insulated using closed cell (non water absorbent) Polyisocyanurate insulation that is not only lightweight and strong but also has a very good R value. The structure of the roof is not only strong enough for multiple people to stand on but it is also double sealed for leak resistance. The roof panels are not only sealed and taped with heavy duty commercial sealants but a one piece membrane with no holes anywhere in it covers the entire length and width of the boat. This membrane is folded down the sides past the roof panel seams assuring water tightness. Extensive research went into the selection of this membrane and the highest rated (independently tested and certified) was the material selected for our application. Naturally, it is also the most expensive.  Once again, no compromise. The outside of the cabin walls are constructed of aluminum sheets that are powder coated on both sides for corrosion and weather resistance. The panels are mechanically fastened on the top and bottom while the longitudinal seams are sealed with genuine 3M VHB double sided commercial vehicle bonding tape. This tape is used extensively in the cargo trailer industry and has replaced rivets that eventually leak. 3M actually sent a representative to our facility to instruct us on the proper way to apply their product BEFORE they would allow us to buy it from their authorized distributor. All trim on the outside of the StarGazer 31 (including the rub rail) is made from top of the line plastic lumber that does NOT use any wood fiber for filler material in its formulation. The walls on the inside of the cabin are sheeted using Aluminum Composite Material (ACM) which is a composite core sandwiched between two sheets of painted aluminum. ACM is very expensive (a lot more money than wooden paneling). It is used in the outdoor sign and building re-skinning industry because of its extreme durability and weather resistance. Using it on interior walls is super overkill but that is the name of our game. The floor of the main cabin and bathroom is covered with a ""waterproof"" (not water resistant) snap and lock product that we purchase directly from Shaw Industries. Shaw is one of the top selling floor covering manufacturers in the world. The StarGazer 31 has large freshwater and black water tanks that are slung dead center underneath the length of the boat. Easy fill and extraction fittings are mounted at the stern of the boat. The same section of the stern holds the small but efficient generator and propane water heater. As mentioned earlier this houseboat is presently under construction at my boatyard here in DeLand, FL. This boat is being used to certify this particular model and is the very same boat that will be independently inspected and certified by NMMA. Right now is the perfect time to have any customization done to the interior or to the trailer. The pictures of the boat are in reverse order back to the beginning of construction. My goal is to offer this entire package of boat, motor, trailer for under $130K.
