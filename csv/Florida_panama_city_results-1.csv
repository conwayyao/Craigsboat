She needs a bottom job and some topside painting but could have the bottom cleaned and sail right now. The motor is not running because she broke an exhaust pipe which I had another one made for it.

The boat was purchased used in 2007 with 36 hours on it and mine since then.  I changed the motor from a 115 yamaha 2 stroke because I wanted more power/ efficiency.  The Suzuki has been fantastic and had no problems whatsoever. The boat has two livewells, 80lb i-pilot (never used), Raymarine Dragonfly 7, Bluetooth stereo with four speakers. If you are familiar with the Blazer bay 2170 you will note that it is the best of the ""Rolled-gunnel"" boats.  It is fully composite so no rot, light, efficient and does very well in chop.  It has splatter paint inside which makes it very easy to clean, care for and live with. Keep in mind this is a used boat so there are the expected used boat issues.  No, its not perfect cosmetically.  Yes, everything works as far as I can tell but that could change next week.  There are four removable seats, bimini top, poling platform.  I have a manual jackplate that can be included as well. The trailer is a Starline Aluminum single axle.
