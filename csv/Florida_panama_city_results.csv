Beneath its stylish good looks, the Sea Ray 290 Amberjack is built to endure the rigors of time and continuous use with high-performance vinylester resin; stainless steel rails, plates and eyes; a self-bailing fiberglass cockpit liner; and high-quality interior fabrics and appointments. Sea Ray's vented chine hull design improves tracking at low speeds, and enhances high-speed maneuverability for outstanding performance on the open water. At the helm of the Sea Ray 290 Amberjack, the spacious double seat with flip-up thigh-rise creates enough room for the captain and navigator to control the craft side by side, with all the latest instrumentation in clear view. There's a 120V outlet and a 12V receptacle - perfect for a spotlight or cell phone. Guests can relax in the portside back-to-back lounger seat or on the convenient aft bench seat which is easily removed to create more space in the cockpit for fishing, or for access to the engine compartment when the gas-assisted hatch is lifted. Storage space is neatly contained throughout the cockpit in the base of the double helm and lounger seats and in the aft transom wall, where shore power and water hookups are also concealed. The walk-through transom leads to a wide add-on swim platform with brackets for easy removal after water sports or diving - The fishing package has every feature seasoned anglers need: a bait prep station with live baitwell system, pre wired for downriggers, aluminum arch with 4 rocket launchers, cockpit toe rail for sure footing, four rod holders, and seawater washdown. Once the team is finished enjoying the great outdoors for the day, the great indoors awaits with a full-service galley with microwave and refrigerator, an opposing dinette that converts to a sleeper, a comfortable forward V-berth, and a fully-enclosed fiberglass standup head with shower, sink and vanity. The 290 Amberjack also features a midcabin sleeper compartment with double bunks which can be used as extra storage space when guests aren't on board. For entertainment, a Clarion AM-FM digital cd stereo with amplifier, six speakers, and a cockpit remote control keeps the music going all day and into the night. And for added peace of mind, Sea Ray installed a standard carbon monoxide detector in the cabin. With rugged twin 5.7 liter, Bravo III stern drives, there's no water the Sea Ray 290 Amberjack can't cut.
