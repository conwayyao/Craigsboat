The interior is in great physical condition. I just purchased earlier this year, but have since determined that the boat is too large for my needs. I used it all summer. At first it ran great, but now it does not have full power. The boat will run around 12 miles per hour in it's current condition- even when wide open.

There is no smoke trouble, fuel leaks, or any major problems I can see. I just replaced the three large batteries, and the smaller generator battery with new batteries. The batteries cost me around $500. It cranks great- no starting trouble. The 12 volt panel in the cabin stopped turning on- I do not know why. The boat comes with a Navico 7"" color GPS chart plotter, marine stereo, TV/DVD, two vhf marine radios, and a Lowrance fishfinder depthsounder. All the electronics work fine.

It was purchased in early 2016, and used as a dingy for a sailboat on one trip from the east coast of Florida to Pensacola and has less than five hours of use. The motor is in new condition. It was purchased locally, and has a transferable five year warranty. A custom lift plate has been installed to put heavy loads on plane quickly. The boat is in perfect condition, and has a seat that can be attached in either the forward or aft position. It also comes with a transferable 5 year warranty. This combination works very well, lifting two 200 lb passengers on plane with a cruising speed of 15 mph. The boat or motor can be purchased separately if you wish. $3,400 for the boat, and $2,500 for the motor.
