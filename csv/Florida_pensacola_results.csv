The only difference in then is the 2015 has a drop down skeg and longer h-rails(side rails). The 2015 is the exact same as the newest PAs. The vantage seats has lumbar support. Both have the turbo fins mirage drives and also come with carbon fiber shaft paddles. These are 3400 new. There is so much you can do with these boats. Tons of room and a 500 pound weight limit. Some people take dogs with them some people take kids with them some people even put a seat behind the vantage seat in the back and take another person fishing with them. You can learn just about anything on YouTube to customize these Hobies to your liking. A very well known brand by fishers and one of the only pedal kayaks on the market. Another positive about this pedal kayak is the pedal Mirage Drive is very simple and easy to use or maintain. Price is 2700$ each but willing to negotiate on a package deal.

I bought the boat as a close-out in 2014, so it's really only been used for two summers with very low hours. It comes with a spare tire already mounted on the trailer. The tongue of the trailer folds away, so it may even fit inside your garage, as well. I also bought it with a 5-year manufacturer's warranty, with 3 years left on the warranty, so this is a longer warranty than is typical from Chaparral. The boat seats 8 comfortably. The boat comes with a depth finder, black bimini top and a cover. This boat is perfect for the river, and it can handle out front, heading to the islands, in mild to moderate seas. The only thing it may need eventually is to have the propeller sharpened, but this has not affected its performance at all. This boat has been very well kept. I'm selling it only because it won't fit in the garage of my next house. This is the perfect little bay boat and you can take it to the islands, if the seas are not too high.
