The entire restoration can be seen here :  https://boatbuildercentral.wordpress.com/2015/10/29/an-in-depth-rebuild-of-a-classic-aquasport-22-flatback/ During the restoration the stringers were replaced with solid core material, the transom was enclosed and a porta bracket was added.  It was rigged with a 2007 Mercury 150 Optimax which currently has 360 hours and was recently serviced with a new oil pump installed and given a clean bill of health.  I cruise at 4000 rpm at 30mph.  The boat was just repainted Seafoam Green in December 2015.  Also new within the last 6 months is the trolling motor (motor guide XI5), the Simrad GO7 chart plotter/fishfinder with navionics .  I recently re-plumbed the live well adding a 1600 gph pump and new 1 1/8 flex hose.  The front casting platform has three hatches, the middle hatch has a cast net bucket inside to keep your net out of the way while fishing.  There is so much more to this boat but talking about it does not do it justice.  A lot of money has gone into this classic boat and to restore one like this would cost a lot more than the asking price.

Visit us on the web at https://www.SarasotaBoatDetailing.com I have been detailing for 14 years now. I like to use 3m compounds then Meguiar's or Collinite Fleet waxes on most boats as a sealant for a lasting and even finish. Average prices $15+ per foot cleaning inside & out, washing and waxing, extensive interior buffing can be additional with some boats. Time is money. 

Cabin cruisers  and boats on lifts are more per foot usually about $20 per foot.

Medium to heavy cutting for more oxidized boats requires 2 foot by 2 foot sections done in one or 2 ,3 step processes which takes considerately longer time. This is what most boats need that have not been machine polished in over a year. The average for this is about $15+ per foot.  

We clean storage compartments, vinyl seating, steering wheel, bottom stains, rust stains, most everything you need to get or keep your boat in the best possible condition. Check out our website for before and after photos of some boats we've done. We work for boat yards and marine mechanics also.  I  have a 27 foot center console and use it almost every weekend for diving ect.  So I am a boat owner for years now. I know what it takes to keep your investment in great shape.  I only use the best compounds, waxes and sealants. 3M, Meguiar's, Collinite Fleet Wax,  Collinite Metal Polish,
