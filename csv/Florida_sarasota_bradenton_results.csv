I am going in partners on a much bigger boat and need money down. This is a great boat I dive off of it mostly fish occasionally. The versatility of this boat is awesome you can do anything with it.. 6 people on a sunset cruise comfortable anything more and it would be tight. Maximum capacity is 8 which is too many but good for weight load. You can hold 8 fishing poles out of the way on it. Has built in tackle box for 3 small boxes 30 gallon live well and all the storage compartment on the boat have drains so they can be used as a fish box or just a ton of storage room. It has 30 gallon fresh water rinse tank. Boat has the full cushion kit on it which pops right off..what I do when fishing. Has a nice cooler with built-in rack but it can be removed and moved to give more room. 104 gallon fuel tank with separate oil tank..have only used yamaha oil in engine. A ton of storrage.Bimini in great shape. This boat loaded has plenty of power gets on plane right away and will do 40mph on the right day. The boat has 2 new batteries with new switch and wiring. It has a brand new Garmin GPS with fish finder and structure finder and other features. Amfm radio. New anchor with 200ft of rope and new chain as well. New rear marine speakers. The boat overall is in excellent condition. It is kept at siesta key marina in dry storage covered it is washed inside and outside and engine flushed after every use. Just had the 100 hour service done at 655 hrs. New water pump New thermostat New fluids Prop pulled Lower dropped as well. Boat runs awesome I take it 15 miles off shore and it doesn't skip a beat it is quick so you could tube with it as well. There is a spot that needs to be caulked very minor I included a picture of it. The horn does not work. The speedometer on the yamaha Guage does not work the gps tells speed so I use that everything else on the Guage works and is accurate just not the speed. That are the only very minor things wrong with this boat.. You will not find another boat this size that can handle sea like this boat. Do the research hydra sports have great hulls.

96,good,[],2016-12-17 23:22,"I have been asked several times for a price to sell my 30 foot pontoon boat that I am working on. It is registered at 30 feet.  It has a full length bimini in good condition and a topside sun deck and a full canvas enclosure that will keep you warm and dry in the worst of weather conditions. The boat is all aluminum with an aluminum deck and is totally solid. It has some special features that you will just have to come by to see. If you want to come and look at it and make an offer I will listen but I am not giving it away. I have replaced the trailer springs with heavy duty ones and have put new tires, cross beams and bunk boards on it.  There is a good running 70 HP Evinrude engine on the boat. If you have your own engine and controls and do not want this one I will reduce the price to $6,200. The controls stay with the engine! Due to a serious health issue that has just reared back up and the wife having serious health issues and a spinal surgery scheduled this week, I am letting it go. Don't waste my time or yours making lowball offers.  I will not consider low offers. I will sell it but I don't HAVE to sell it and I won't give it away.  I would consider some trade or barter.  This boat is very unique and has a lot of special features that you won't see on other pontoon boats. Come by and check it out but please call first so I'll be sure to be there. The trailer is quite capable of handling the boat and all equipment at sustained highway speeds anywhere you would like to go. I have replaced the springs with heavy duty ones and replaced cross members, all bunk boards and tires and rims. Like I said; you won't find another pontoon with some of the upgrades and features that this one has.  It has a full enclosure of the rear cabin and all the way up to the dinette that encloses half of the boat. With side curtains or canvas for the front deck you could enclose the entire boat. The canvass and clear enclosure will really extend your seasonal use to year round. It can be heated and air conditioned. It has several features you will not find on any other pontoon boats that you will have to see to believe.

99,good,[],2016-12-17 22:59,"I bought this boat a few weeks ago and have been working on it. It is getting very near finished but health issues have come up and I have decided to sell it as is. I can finish the work on it if you want but we will have to discus that after you look at the boat. The engine is an 80 HP Mercury and it is running great, It has 155 pounds of compression on all cylinders but the tilt and trim doesn't work and the shifter and throttle controller has been stolen.  I have been doing some repainting and still have a little to do. I repair and upgrade boats for a living and wanted to have this boat for myself. Stop by and have a look at it and we can discuss it. The wife has had spinal surgery and will be bed ridden for several weeks. I may not be able to get to the shop as much as I would like so if you want to see the boat I would suggest calling first. I may be having to stay home to take care of the wife if she is not doing well. Family first, business will have to wait if the wife needs me to do something. I am retired and do not have to keep the shop open to make a living. I would like to sell this boat and some others I have but I do not HAVE to sell them. Don't think I will listen to lowball offers. It won't happen. I am not interested in having you sell the boat for me nor will I deal with second parties or shippers. If you can not deal with me face to face, don't waste my time. Stay off the boats if I am not at the shop. Security has been notified. Boarding a boat is trespassing. I am at 1326 37th Ave East at the Manatee Storage and Garage rental complex.
