New Raymarine Navigation, GPS, RADAR and Wind system. Please see attached S Photos for added info. Also have 2015 survey on request. Boat is at our dock in Palmetto FL. The longwinded details are listed below: Allied Princess 36' Ketch Rig $42,000 Location/Port:  Palmetto Florida The lead photo shows Vindalf II cruising with full sails complement. Set the sails, helm, engage autopilot and enjoy the ride.  Our selection for the Princess was the need for a solid shallow draft cruiser, under 50' bride mast clearance, full keel and fellow sailor recommendations. A haul out in April 2015 resulted in the following action: * two coats of bottom paint and the normal repairs * replacement and inspection of  all system components which included changing the cutlass bearing, pulling the rudder and repairing a small open seam, replacement of  original bronze prop shaft with new stainless including replacing the PSS shaft seal, bottom inspecting the through hulls etc. In May 2015 Vindalf II underwent a further haul out for a marine survey prior to our purchase. Since purchase we have enjoyed the boat immensely however due to a change in circumstances we are forced to part with her. We are travelling overseas and are unsure of our return date.  It's time to pass her on to the next owner to enjoy her sea kindliness, safety and pure sailing fun and adventure. Our intent is  to fairly distinguish systems conditions and accurately describe the vessels strengths and attributes.  I provide  a snapshot of the extensive inventory and will be happy to provide detailed answers and additional  photos to any questions. Rather then dwelling on marketing the qualities of the Allied Princess I leave that to the experts and refer you to the websites listed below. http://www.sailfeed.com/2012/03/allied-princess-36-a-robust-cruising-ketch/ http://www.cruisingworld.com/sailboats/allied-seabreeze-mistress-princess-diverse-fleet-classic-plastics http://www.boats.com/boat-content/2010/03/allied-princess-36/ Herein is a current list of  the  conditions and equipment of  the Vindalf II. Walk Through and Accommodations The cockpit is large and comfortable with Edson worm gear wheel steering. Compass, depth and wind instruments are mounted in cockpit.  Navionics Chart, Fishfinder, Radar and Other Multifunction Display data are viewed and controlled in the cockpit via I-pad connected thru Raymarine A77 MFD wireless network.  The cockpit has a huge lazerette access to starboard with hot water heater forward. Teak trim gives the cockpit a comfortable, traditional look.  A generous standing room Bimini and Dodger provides protection and comfort. Previous electrical panel located in cockpit well has been relocated with gauges to the helm and rpm to the port bulkhead  thereby preventing any damage from a flooded cockpit.  The traveler has been relocated from the bridge deck to the top of cabin eliminating cockpit clutter and improving boom control. As you come down the steps from the large 10' long and 6' wide cockpit into the 6'4"" headroom cabin the galley is to starboard with an ample quarter berth for cruising and storage when not in use, and navigation station with large work space to port. Moving forward, the main salon consists of two settees with great storage below and behind the settees and open shelves outboard. There is a large drop leaf table that folds against the bulkhead when not in use, giving the salon the feel of a much larger boat. The port settee opens out to provide a double bunk. Settee and V berth cushions were new in '95 and are in good condition. The salon has a large opening hatch, six opening ports and a dorade vent.   The storage under the settees is accessible from the front so you do not have to dig under cushions to get stuff. The head is forward to port with shower and storage outboard and behind. The head has doors to both the forward cabin and salon. Ventilation is provided by an opening port and another dorade vent. There is a holding tank and deck fitting and macerator pump for offshore use. Across from the head is a dresser with five drawers and opening port. The forward cabin has a vanity with sink and storage behind to port and hanging locker to starboard. There is a king sized V berth with drawers and storage under and shelves outboard. Good ventilation is provided by a large opening hatch and two opening ports. There is a divided chain locker in the forepeak. A marine Air system 12,000 BTU AC system ensures comfortable quarters while at dock.
