This boat spent its entire life around the Washington, D.C. area (still has a 2013 Potomac River fishing decal). This Steiger Craft has always been a private/pleasure use vessel and appears to have been stored on a trailer inside its entire life. It never had bottom paint until I had it professionally done within the year. The extensive canvas is a full enclosure of Sunbrella fabric and is recently done and still like new. The 130 Mercury is dependable and has had a recent rebuild and the Bravo II out drive has been recently redone for complete dependability. There are new cushions in the cabin and a Garmin GPS is mounted as is a separate Garmin depth/fish finder. Has bowsprit with anchor. Included is an excellent Shoreline tandem axle trailer that is equipped with rollers for easy loading. If you are unfamiliar with Block Island boats, check them out online. They are a heavy duty vessel that are classic designed. Recent engine and out drive rebuild offers years of dependable service. This boat is beautiful, rugged, unique and dependable with an outstanding heritage. It is still produced because it is a great boat--maybe last one you will ever need because of the lifetime hull guarantee from the manufacturer. It is a 1998 and looks almost identical to current production Block Islands. If my Block Island Steiger Craft might be for you, just reply to this posting and I will be in touch.

With NO Wood in this boat, The Klegecell makes it fast, dry, quiet,  and greatly reduces the chance of spooking the fish stalking your prey on the Bonefish Flats and poling the back country.  The 13"" wide gunwales provide for easy walk-around fighting fish, and the narrow console gives plenty of cockpit room.  A bench seat with flip-down back rest, and there is dry storage underneath for two trolling motor batteries, tackle boxes, or whatever. The live well has recessed fittings which keep bait alive and frisky. It has  a Fighting Lady Yellow Hull,  Livewell,Fish box, Poling Platform, 16 Rod Holders, Trim Tabs, Bench Seat with flip down back rest at the helm with storage under,  Pop Up Push Pole holder, Pop Up Cleats, VHF, and powered by a 115hp Yamaha 4 stroke.
