Of all the Carolina Skiff series, the JVX is considered the king of versatility. Not only does the JVX come in three different sizes (16, 18, and 20-foot models) but it's also available in two different control points (center console and side console), providing 12 different models to choose from.Creating even more versatility is the fact that each JVX model is built on our modified-V hull, which is 100 percent composite and wood free. Capable of running over flats to fish shallow, the JVX also has the guts to run across choppy bays and on the outside beaches when called upon. And though the JVX comes standard with a pre-wired trolling motor plug, full instrumentation and live well, you can continue to add more versatility with options like a bimini top or T-top.

She is being pulled by a triple axle aluminum trailer. This boat is AWESOME and HUGE standing at 30' long and an amazing beam width of 10'.  Please note pictures do this boat NO JUSTICE of real size or beauty.  She Holds up to 12 people and runs 55Mph and has a 200 gallon gas tank.  Fully equipped with working transom live well , twin bilge pumps, wash down, 30gallon fresh water tank and VHF radio.  Only thing that needs replaced is the Lowrance head unit.  Also has a step down inside and  under the center console that you can use as a bathroom but We use it as storage instead. One of my favorite things about the boat is the nice twin outboard bracket that you can Fish and walk on outside the boat. The bracket it self is holding 450Hp on the back giving the boat a great hull shot along with top end. Another one of my favorites and probably the nicest thing to have is never having to throw out or pull back in an anchor EVER AGAIN. All That is done with a push of a button with this nice Windless anchor.  One push drops the anchor and another push of the button  pulls her back in.  Also included is 2 - 15' out riggers which including the beam of the boat throws out about a 50Ft spread when trolling.  When trolling we usually run 7-8 lines including the riggers.  If your looking for a great off shore boat that handles waves great and is a fishing machine then look NO further.  This is a turn key boat ready to go.
