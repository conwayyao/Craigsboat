Aluminum seats and an incredibly stable design make it a great fishing vessel. The compact size makes it the perfect choice for a dinghy for a yacht or sailboat. The SATURN KaBoat is capable of transporting heavier cargo and offers a more stable design than that of a traditional kayak. The narrow profile allows for much less drag and allows it to outperform most traditional dinghy's with similar engine sizes. The 14' Saturn Kaboat can take up to a 10 HP gas outboard engine if you really want to fly and if you're looking for maximum portability just purchase an electric motor! If the battery loses charge or the gas is low, you can use the rowing oars to paddle to your destination. A small outboard works great and you don't need anything larger than a 6 HP. With a 3.5 HP engine, this boat will fly at up to 15-20 mph with 2 people. With an electric motor you'll be able to travel at speeds of around 5-7 mph. An electric motor at minimum speed will run for up to 6 hours. Additional Features: Same heavy-duty 1100 Denier PVC as in SATURN inflatable boats. Wide beam hull design for stability. Front Spray Skirt with water deflector guard and rope lacing. Marine grade plywood transom with a one way drain plug.

She is being pulled by a triple axle aluminum trailer. This boat is AWESOME and HUGE standing at 30' long and an amazing beam width of 10'.  Please note pictures do this boat NO JUSTICE of real size or beauty.  She Holds up to 12 people and runs 55Mph and has a 200 gallon gas tank.  Fully equipped with working transom live well , twin bilge pumps, wash down, 30gallon fresh water tank and VHF radio.  Only thing that needs replaced is the Lowrance head unit.  Also has a step down inside and  under the center console that you can use as a bathroom but We use it as storage instead. One of my favorite things about the boat is the nice twin outboard bracket that you can Fish and walk on outside the boat. The bracket it self is holding 450Hp on the back giving the boat a great hull shot along with top end. Another one of my favorites and probably the nicest thing to have is never having to throw out or pull back in an anchor EVER AGAIN. All That is done with a push of a button with this nice Windless anchor.  One push drops the anchor and another push of the button  pulls her back in.  Also included is 2 - 15' out riggers which including the beam of the boat throws out about a 50Ft spread when trolling.  When trolling we usually run 7-8 lines including the riggers.  If your looking for a great off shore boat that handles waves great and is a fishing machine then look NO further.  This is a turn key boat ready to go.
