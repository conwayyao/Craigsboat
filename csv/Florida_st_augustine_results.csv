Other items included in the sale are mohogany planks of various sizes (under tarps below her), a GM Detroit Diesel 4-71 (original engine to the ship), spare gearbox, new 3"" shaft (installed, packed, and sealed previous to purchase).

Freshly rebuilt (2015/2016) 3208N Caterpillar diesels (500 Hours Stbd / 300 Hours Port after rebuild). 3208N's are very reliable and efficient and are known to make 10,000+ hours of service. That's a lifetime of fishing with proper maintenance and care. Almost every component on these motors have been replaced and they run great. No smoke on start up. All electronics, eisenglass, and 8D Batteries were new in 2015. Honest 18 Knot cruise at 2000 RPMS. 20 knots at 2200rpms. 26 knots at WOT. Needs nothing to fish or cruise today. Crank it up and take it wherever you want. Needs some awlgrip to pretty it up after being fished hard for the past two years. This is not a show boat, but has not sat idle for years and is mechanically very strong.

She is 46 foot on deck, 41 foot at the waterline, 15 foot beam, draft 3'10"". This vessel has been neglected for a few years and needs TLC.  The deck was re-caulked a few years ago and appears not to leak, however, varnish work does need attention. She survived hurricane Matthew (October 2016) with no damage whatsoever. This is a project boat that needs lots of attention, but would reward you with a very comfortable and valuable asset. Owner has been living on board for a couple of weeks a year, but otherwise, she has been mostly empty for the last five years. The boat has been sitting in St.  Augustine for the last decade. The engines used to work, but the owner has not moved the boat a long time. The bottom was last scrubbed February 2016 (new zincs), but boat has not been hauled for years. It is believed one propeller might be missing. Inboard 1985 Perkins diesel engines, model 8534 x 2 Hours: port - 9hrs; stbd - 732hrs. Onan 12KW Genset, running condition not known. 15 gallon Raritan 110 hot water heater, produces a hot showers. Vacuum flush toilets, forward and aft, have not worked for some time. Bilge pump's appear to work fine. Forward cabin has double bunks to port, needs reupholstering. Forward head has a working shower and sink, and decorative floor tiles. L shaped galley, with substantial cabinet and draw storage. Includes working fridge, microwave, three burner electric stove (not been used recently), large sink with fresh water. There is a washing machine, but it hasn't been used in years and probably doesn't work. Across from galley, is U-shaped dinette table, which can be lowered by use of rack and pinion crank on pedestal  base to form queen size bed. Upholstery very tired. Saloon has L-shaped couch with stowage beneath. Steering wheel has been removed and the lower helm control is disconnected (steering wheel still there).
