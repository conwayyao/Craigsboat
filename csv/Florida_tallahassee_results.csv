Boat includes a very good Hull, tiller, rudder, mainsail, Jib, mast, boom, keel, tiller, van boom, lines, (ropes), anchor, down hall, 2 way radio, compass, cabin, porta poty, outside and inside lights, new breaker board, new battery, solar battery tender, sinks, rails, tiller stabilizer, pulleys, transom, swim ladder, outboard bracket, blocks, All in very good shape. There is some spider web cracking on the deck. We recently had the mast step reinforced. Easy to use mast stepping rig included. Hull is in very good condition. There is although no water tank or hand pumps or gray or black water holding tanks (but easily installed) as we used this boat for day sailing and found it best to bring on fresh water on every trip and use the porta poty. This boat is an excellent coastal cruiser, not a blue water boat. That means you could sail from Florida up the coast following the East coast and up to Canada and down the Mississippi river and back home to Florida if you wanted. You would not want to go to Europe with this boat, at least I would not. Trailer is very heavy duty galv tandem, with good tires but needs new lights. Outboard is newer mercury 4 cycle long shaft 9.9 hp. Dive equipment includes 2 built in air tanks, 2 regulators, 1 BC vest, weights but no mask or snorkel or fins or dive suits. But does include 2 sections of 50' dive hoses that allows you to leave the tanks on the boat and enables you to dive with no tanks on your back. $3,500 for boat alone, add $2,000 for trailer, add $2,000 for outboard and add 1,000 for dive equipment. Or $8500 for everything And I might be tempted to give the buyer 2 basic sailing lessons as long as it is less than 99 miles from my home.
