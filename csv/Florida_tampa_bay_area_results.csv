97,excellent,"['27.670500', '-82.711900']",2016-12-18 14:52,"Up for sale is our 40' Hunter. You will not find another Hunter in this price range/condition better equipped and cared for. Take note that this is a in mast roller furling, rigged with 125% Jib (roller Furling), Spinnaker with mast stowed whisker pole, easy to sail single handed or with short crew, she will sail close to the wind, is fast and sails excellent! This is a serious boat, no major damage ever. Just a clean ready to go cruising to the Islands. Rare opportunity to purchase a serious cruise ready, safe comfortable sailboat in this price range. One very important note on this vessel, you will notice that other Hunters of the same model/year have torpedo transoms. Seeker has the Sugar Scoop. For me, we love to anchor in hid away inlets and coves and swim around and play, scuba dive and just enjoy the turquoise waters. There is no more accommodating design than the Sugar Scoop stern for this. Not to mention that it is so much easier to get on and off at the marina and makes it a much safer situation for a man overboard situation. The Hunter Legend 40 combines excellent sailing characteristics with attractive living accommodations. She is fast and fun to sail, and is a comfortable home when you drop the hook or arrive back at the dock. The aft master suite is huge, with a centerline queen and an abundance of storage. She has a guest suite forward, two heads with showers, a large and comfortable salon, a well-designed galley and a cleverly executed navigation station. You will be hard-pressed to find another boat in this price range that will provide the level of comfort, flexibility, and good sailing performance that no other boat in this class can offer. Brad show contact info Call with any questions. May trade for early Ford, 30-32'. This boat will survey, Don't buy a junker to follow your dreams, get one that will take you there in comfort, safety and style! I will include as much as I can to make this a sail ready vessel, life vests, Flares, horn clean bottom, tank full of fuel ready to go.
