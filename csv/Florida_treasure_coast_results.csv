30,new,,2016-12-11 13:33,"2017 Eastward Coastal 2200. This boat bridges the gap between a Bay Boat and an Offshore Center Console. Overall length 22', Beam 8'-6"". 72-gallon fuel tank. It has the draft of a bay boat and can accept a bow-mounted trolling motor, but with a higher freeboard and a closed transom, this bay boat performs better offshore than any other boat in its class. The high-performance hull design is rock-solid while running and at rest. This versatile boat can fish freshwater lakes, saltwater estuaries, inlets, bays and offshore. The roomy cockpit is larger than most 24' boats and has lockable rod storage for 10 outfits (including your 9' fly rods). Dual livewells, aft, keep bait frisky and easily accessible. The bow casting platform features two large fiberglass hatches that open to an impressive amount of room for your dry storage needs. The entire front of the center console lifts with enough room for a head. Innovative helm seating includes custom upholstered seats that conform to your body and allow you to drive comfortably from a seated position. No need to stand all day to operate your boat. The stern has a cushioned couch. This boat is constructed with exceptional attention to every detail, something that you can only get from a boat manufacturer that builds each boat one at a time, custom rigged, to the owner's specifications. This package includes a new tandem axle aluminum trailer and a 200 hp Evinrude G2 with 6 years of warranty, plus a 4 blade SS prop. Cruise at 36 MPH getting 4.8 MPG or hit 52 MPH and still get 2.8 MPG. Retail price as rigged is over 50K, this boat can be bought for 46,800.

We've steadily upgraded certain components on the boat for inter-coastal fishing to what it is today. This boat is a turn key, ready to fish or cruise. Features: Engine completely rebuilt by Ray's Marine in Grant Valkaria November 2013 to the tune of $2400. Boat can easily do 35 MPH with bimini down and seats stowed. It cruises at 20-25 MPH easily no matter the passenger count or seat/bimini configuration. This is the perfect boat for the inter-coastal, it drafts about 5"" of water with the motor up and two guys fishing. It burns about 5 gallons of gas over a full day of fishing. There has been no damage, or holes ever in the hull. -New axle, hubs, and springs - installed September 2015 -Minkota iPilot Riptide 50lb thrust trolling motor with remote control and GPS control - installed Spring 2013 -Two deep cycle batteries - installed Winter 2012 -Stowable bimini - installed Summer 2012 -Garmin Echo 200 depth finder - installed Summer 2013 -Custom made heavy duty boat/motor cover -- purchased December 2013 after the previous Wal-Mart cover ripped -Tons of under deck storage -No soft spots anywhere Issues: Aerator pump for live well is not working Some of the graphics on the hull and engine cowling are starting to peel (visible in pictures) The carpet has worn around the forward deck hatch We are selling this boat because our family has almost doubled in size since we purchased it and we cannot take everyone on the boat at once anymore. We are looking at upgrading to a pontoon boat and possibly a PWC. This boat can be water tested with ME driving if you bring cash with you. Other wise you're welcome to come see it on the trailer in my yard. The condition you see it in is how it is kept at all times, I did not spend extra time cleaning the boat prior to the pictures being taken.
