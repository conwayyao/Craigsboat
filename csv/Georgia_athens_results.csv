Complete service last May (See picture of the repair order).   I love this boat because she  is very easy to rig (~30 minutes) and launch due to the 9"" draft and weight. Great boat to learn on and for the experts. Holds 6 people comfortably (We sleep 5 on our 2 week trips to the Florida Keys). Comes with all standard equipment to sail now.  Also, we have all the goodies that do not come with other similar boats. We chose this model over the newer 26M because of the cabin layout.  It is more open and allows you to extend the V-berth about 18"" when sleeping.  It also allows the air to flow freely in the cabin.  Also, the swing keel is very forgiving in the shallow waters (Florida Keys).  It will simply kick back, rather than breaking off and causing damage to the hull.   We don't, but you can raise the keel and beach on a sandbar during low tide and the boat will sit flat.
