0,,,2016-12-20 20:37,"Free service to you, huge blessing to me! In and around douglasville area: Please read entire post. Do you have any non running, or even running for that matter, lawn mowers, push or pull, that you just need out of the way? Perhaps you have weedeaters, blowers, or maybe a chainsaw that no longer works and they are taking up space? While I'm there, I'd also love to pick up those old wheelbarrows, working electric blowers, working electric weedeaters and those working electric edgers that you just no longer use. I would also be love to pick up any of those broken down Go karts, scooters, atvs's, anything that has a small engine on in it that is taking up space and you want someone to get it out of your way, all while knowing you are truly blessing a family by allowing me to help you get back that space? Well here is a chance for us to help each other!! Honestly, I know in most cases it will be helping me much more than it is you and for that, I will be and I am very grateful and appreciative for that blessing. Condition of the items is of no importance because I am constantly in need of parts. Having parts is what's most important so it doesn't matter if motor is locked up, still a blessing to me, right now parts is my biggest need to make this keep working. Pm me if you have something you would like me to pick up and we can set up a convenient time. I will note, during the hours of 11am-2:30pm is my most convenient time due to the kids, bus and all, but that doesn't mean I can never pick up outside those hours. Also as a side note, if I'm there picking up a mower or something, it would be my pleasure to haul off any non working flat panel tvs, laptops, desktop computer towers, old cell phones, anything mostly copper, aluminum, or brass items, even that collection of old keys, which are brass, old car and truck batteries. NOW, If you want to know more about me, and why I ask am doing this,  please read on. What's going on in my family's life, A little over 2 years ago I injured my shoulder and had to have surgery, during my recovery and rehab I began picking up scrap metal and any small engines I was blessed with, I honed my skills as a small engine mechanic and sold them. I did this so that I could still do my part to help provide for my family. Fast forward 2 years, I have recovered and am ready to start the career that I graduated from college for right before my surgery. However, as I readied for my job search, we were blessed with the opportunity to take guardianship  of my 4 nephews for an undetermined amount of time.That makes 7 kids in our home since January of 2016. Well, with daycare expenses and everything else, it just makes sense for me to continue to repair small engines such as mowers and weedeaters etc for resell to do my part because it allows me to be at home most of the time. I'm not afraid to say that God has blessed us and we are not going hungry, we have clothes on all our backs, and a roof over our head, and much of the blessing has come from the kindness of others that have allowed me to pick up from them in the past! If you are someone who has blessed me, thank you so much for being a blessing to us. So This is where I am, what I've been doing and that's why it is a blessing to have you allow me to get them out of your way. Sorry for the lengthy post, but thank you for reading this far and have a truly wonderful and blessed day.

If you have ever spray painted something then you know spray paint just does not last. Powder coat is a more expensive process but is much more resistant to rust. It also keeps your trailer looking new for years to come. *One piece out side frames made from 4 inch box steel. Our trailers are unique in this manufacturing process. Most trailers use several welded pieces to achieve their shape. Ours are cut to length, then shaped creating a much stronger, cleaner looking trailer. The trailer listed here has a ""weight carrying capacity of 3920 lbs. *3 front stairs leading to a platform with a curved hand rail for safety. *9 lights with LED lights in the fenders. Lights make an object much more visible than reflective tape. *New, 13 inch, 6 ply trailer tires. *Acculube brand hubs featuring rubber unbreakable caps. *1500lb tongue jack with 2 wheels. *4 heavy duty drive on guides. *Rear heavy duty welded tie down eyelets. *Wide frame. This insures that no matter how wide your pontoon boat is, it will ride in the middle of the trailer for a much safer ride. Our wider frame also greatly reduces the risk of roll over while towing. *Written one year warranty. This gives our customers piece of mind in the purchase of their trailer. *Fully adjustable bunks, and stairs. We will even adjust the trailer to your boats specs to take the headache out of sizing. Compare our trailers and see why we earn such high praises from our customers. We would appreciate the opportunity to earn your business as well.
