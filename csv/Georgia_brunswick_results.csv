4,excellent,,2016-12-19 19:26,"Very low hours -- this 4-stroke Honda 2HP outboard is definitely attractive. A silver plastic cover on top with matching grey bottom, the outboard looks simple and sleek. The exterior components consist of the easy to access fuel cap, carrying handles on both sides of the outboard, a 360-degrees handle, engine stop switch. Looking under the cover reveals a clean uncluttered layout. Inside is the carburetor, spark plugs are well hidden but easily accessed with the tools provided, recoil starter, and a built-on gas tank that holds 1/4 gallon of 87 octane fuel. Since the BF2D is air cooled it doesn't have any bulky components such as a water pump, and no oil filter is needed. This already indicates an outboard that will require very little maintenance. Picking up the outboard wasn't even close to back breaking and makes the Honda a great outboard to use for hand launches. The Honda BF2D small outboard is packed with many useful features The BF2D that we're looking at is a Short shaft model having a transom height of 16.5 inches (418 mm). At the top of the shaft is a sturdy stern bracket with clamp screws that make installation onto any watercraft very quick and easy. Near the other end you will find the exhaust, a node to help protect the outboard motor from corrosion, and the 3-blade hard plastic propeller which has a diameter of 7-1/4 inches by  4-3/4 inches of pitch. The entire package is well thought out and already gave us a good first impression of this little outboard. Honda's 4-Stroke Advantages: Building on their experience of building and selling 4-stroke outboards over 30 years in the US, Honda continues to update their technology to provide key advantages over other outboard manufacturers.  In the competitor 2-stroke outboards they relied on gas or air to carry a thin oil film to different components. Whereas the Honda's 4-stroke bathe every critical components in oil under constant pressure. 2-stroke outboards also contains ports on the cylinders and pistons which results in the wearing of certain parts. The new 4-stroke technology uses no ports, and as a result will last longer. The 2-stroke cylinder design used ports which isn't as rugged as the 4-stroke design that's port-less, meaning longer service life with less maintenance Other advantages of Honda's 4-stroke motors include less maintenance, easy oil servicing, unlike 2-strokes that burn a lot of oil. the engine efficiency also results in a smooth quieter ride.",20,5926158485,,3,,Honda,,,$425,power, (St. Simons Island),Honda 2hp outboard motor,https://brunswick.craigslist.org/boa/5926158485.html,

I can provide a bill of sale but have no titles. I can help you get titled in GA (GA can use a bill of sale to get title), then you could transfer title to FLA.

She is powered by twin Cummins QSB 6.7L 480 H/O turbo diesels (60 hours) paired up to Zeus drives. This Sea Ray has been meticulously maintained, and all services are completely up-to-date. Mechanical work and services have been performed by the local authorized Sea Ray Dealer. The vessel is maintained on a professional, cleaning and waxing program and it shows!!! The gel coat really shines and all brightwork looks great! This 2015 Sea Ray 470 Sundancer is likely the nicest Preowned 470 in the country, due to its excellent condition and its low hours. The manner in which Owner maintains the vessel has really kept this Sea Ray looking like new. The boat living on inland Lake Lanier, under cover hasn't hurt either!!! The Owner is selling the boat due to health issues. The boat is loaded with the following features and options: Factory installed DSS Satellite TV System, Built In Cockpit Grill, Underwater Lighting, Premium Audio Upgrade, Dual-Halogen Spotlight, Central Vac, Macerator, Sunroof Sunshades, Cockpit Electric Retractable Sunshade, Cockpit Seat Covers, Windshield Shades, Canvas Aft Curtain, High Gloss Teak Cockpit Table, Raymarine Autopilot, Raymarine E165W Chart Plotter/GPS/Radar, a second Raymarine E165W Chart Plotter, Inboard Joystick Docking System, Oil Exchange System, High Gloss Light Cherry Cabinetry, Light Carpet, Light Cherry Wood Blinds, Hardwood Flooring in Salon, Galley and Sunroom, 11.5 kW diesel generator, Teak Flooring in Upper Cockpit and Cockpit, All Chain Anchor Rode, Dual Raymarine MF units, Yacht Flag and Lots More!!! The Owner made a visit to the factory and worked with Sea Ray engineers to customize the boat in such a way to address safety, storage, and sleeping arrangements. An emphasis was made on keeping the boat as light and airy as possible. This was achieved by utilizing light cherry cabinetry, light carpeting, light hardwoods and custom Sandlewood (light colored) countertops. The chocolate vinyl and countertop hues that were present in the Sea Ray design were omitted throughout. Blue hues were introduced into the cabin instead of the darker chocolate brown, brightening up the overall feel and presentation of this Sea Ray 470 Sundancer. Please call for additional photos and a list of additional custom touches that were added during the build process. The whole boat is very clean and lovingly maintained by the Owner and any visitor would agree!!! This boat includes the Cummins Assurance Plan through May 2018, and Brunswick's Passport Premiere Warranty through 4/2021. Financing is available and Trades will be considered!
