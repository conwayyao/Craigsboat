2,new,,2016-12-20 19:56,"We are Mco Trailers. Our business is pontoon boat trailers. Listed here is our 22 to 24ft pontoon trailer. Features include: *Powder Coat Finish. If you have ever spray painted something then you know spray paint just does not last. Powder coat is a more expensive process but is much more resistant to rust. It also keeps your trailer looking new for years to come. *One piece out side frames made from 4 inch box steel. Our trailers are unique in this manufacturing process. Most trailers use several welded pieces to achieve their shape. Ours are cut to length, then shaped creating a much stronger, cleaner looking trailer. This one has a weight carrying capacity of 3,920 lbs. *3 front stairs leading to a platform with a curved hand rail for safety. *9 lights with LED lights in the fenders. Lights make an object much more visible than reflective tape. *New, 13 inch, 6 ply trailer tires. *Acculube brand hubs featuring rubber unbreakable caps. *1500lb tongue jack with 2 wheels. *4 heavy duty drive on guides. *Rear heavy duty welded tie down eyelets. *Wide frame. This insures that no matter how wide your pontoon boat is, it will ride in the middle of the trailer for a much safer ride. Our wider frame also greatly reduces the risk of roll over while towing. *Written one year warranty. This gives our customers piece of mind in the purchase of their trailer. *Fully adjustable bunks, and stairs. We will even adjust the trailer to your boats specs to take the headache out of sizing. Compare our trailers and see why we earn such high praises from our customers. We would appreciate the opportunity to earn your business as well. If there are any questions we could answer for you please let us know. mcotrailers.com Thank you, Lee M-co Trailers",,5927570895,,28,,,,,$1995,power, (West Ga),22 / 24ft pontoon boat trailers,https://nwga.craigslist.org/bod/5927570895.html,
