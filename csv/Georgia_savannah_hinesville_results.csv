28,,,2016-12-19 19:17,"Very low hours -- this 4-stroke Honda 2HP outboard is definitely attractive. A silver plastic cover on top with matching grey bottom, the outboard looks simple and sleek. The exterior components consist of the easy to access fuel cap, carrying handles on both sides of the outboard, a 360-degrees handle, engine stop switch. Looking under the cover reveals a clean uncluttered layout. Inside is the carburetor, spark plugs are well hidden but easily accessed with the tools provided, recoil starter, and a built-on gas tank that holds 1/4 gallon of 87 octane fuel. Since the BF2D is air cooled it doesn't have any bulky components such as a water pump, and no oil filter is needed. This already indicates an outboard that will require very little maintenance. Picking up the outboard wasn't even close to back breaking and makes the Honda a great outboard to use for hand launches. The Honda BF2D small outboard is packed with many useful features The BF2D that we're looking at is a Short shaft model having a transom height of 16.5 inches (418 mm). At the top of the shaft is a sturdy stern bracket with clamp screws that make installation onto any watercraft very quick and easy. Near the other end you will find the exhaust, a node to help protect the outboard motor from corrosion, and the 3-blade hard plastic propeller which has a diameter of 7-1/4 inches by 4-3/4 inches of pitch. The entire package is well thought out and already gave us a good first impression of this little outboard. Honda's 4-Stroke Advantages: Building on their experience of building and selling 4-stroke outboards over 30 years in the US, Honda continues to update their technology to provide key advantages over other outboard manufacturers. In the competitor 2-stroke outboards they relied on gas or air to carry a thin oil film to different components. Whereas the Honda's 4-stroke bathe every critical components in oil under constant pressure. 2-stroke outboards also contains ports on the cylinders and pistons which results in the wearing of certain parts. The new 4-stroke technology uses no ports, and as a result will last longer. The 2-stroke cylinder design used ports which isn't as rugged as the 4-stroke design that's port-less, meaning longer service life with less maintenance Other advantages of Honda's 4-stroke motors include less maintenance, easy oil servicing, unlike 2-strokes that burn a lot of oil. the engine efficiency also results in a smooth quieter ride.",20,5926150952,,3,,Honda,,2hp 4 stroke,$425,power, (St. Simons Island),2HP Honda Outboard 4 stroke,https://savannah.craigslist.org/boa/5926150952.html,
