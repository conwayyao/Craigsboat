Spotless, loaded, and always stored indoors, I'm selling the boat and every accessory you need to go boating. This boat is mechanically perfect.  The motor was just rebuilt, with maintenance records and receipts (literally has zero hours on the motor), new impeller, spark plugs, and fluids.  Get a great deal on my GT 185 with the XL package, an extended swim platform, Satellite/CD/AM/FM four speaker sound system, Faria gauges, depth finder, full snap in carpet, pilot seat bolster, tilt steering, stainless steel upgrades, and more. This boat looks like it did the day it came from the factory. Powered by a 135hp 3.0L Volvo Penta engine with a Volvo Penta outdrive, it tops out at 50mph, but sips gas while cruising. Tows easily on a single axle EZ Loader trailer, factory painted to match - with surge brakes, bearing buddies, and a swing away tongue.

4,excellent,,2016-12-18 16:54,"Offering up for sale is our well kept, one owner San Juan 23 sailboat. Purchased new in 1979 with a matching Calkins trailer. It's spent it's life in and with our family, seen many vacations in Puget Sound, Wa., B.C. Canada, San Francisco, Monterey and Oakland Bays, as well as plenty of time on the water in the lakes in an around California, Wisconsin and now Illinois. It has always fared well no matter the weather, never left us stranded and always brought us home safe and sound. She's a great boat, and has been part of many  happy memories. It is with sadness, but happiness that it's time to pass her on to another family to enjoy. She's a smooth sailer, swing keel, rigged for single-handed sailing. I've solo'd this boat at 14 years of age and was very comfortable doing so. Both the hull and deck are rock solid, with ZERO deflection in either. The teak could use refinishing, hull and deck could use a good buffing/waxing but she cleans up good and is perfectly usable right now, as is. There are at least four sails, including the main sail, working jib, genoa and spinnaker. All are in great condition with no rips, tears, holes or patches. There is possibly a spare main sail, but I'd have to make sure. All hardware and gear is in proper working order, and everything needed to run the spinnaker is there. It will need batteries and a new selector switch. As far as I know all of the lights work, but again, needs batteries. There is more interior cabin space thn many boats her size. Perfect for either day, weekend or weeklong getaways. She's set up to sleep 4. There's a forward berth and two cabin-length bench seats that are suitable for sleeping on. Portable head in the forward berth. LOTS of storage room, ad by LOTS I mean A TON of storage room. Fold down table for dining, sink, and portable stove (if I can find it). All running rigging is in good shape and she'll come with everything I have for her including anchors, seat cushions and swim ladders. Comes with the outboard motor she's had with her for years. It's a Honda 7.5 that's been entirely converted to a 10.0, only still has the 7.5 cover. It's a great, dependable outboard that usually starts on the first pull, every time. 5 gallon gas can included. Don't let her age fool you. She's a great boat with plenty of life left, just needs a little face lift and a good cleaning. I have no fears or apprehensions in running this boat anywhere and would be completely comfortable with dropping her in the water tomorrow for a weekend trip somewhere. The trailer is in great shape and is also ready to run. It does need the lights fixed up but I have it ready to go with temporary (magnetic) lights. It's got ""Bearing Buddies"" installed and greased up about 600 miles ago. We just pulled boat and  trailer down from Central Wisconsin and had zero issues. Pulls straight and true. It's equipped with ""surge brakes"" and as far as I know or can tell, they work. Replacement parts are still readily available for both boat and trailer. Titles are in hand for both. Come make her yours and start up some photo albums of your own great happy family memories. She'll be there for you, ready to go at  moment's notice. I'd love to get $3,500 for her, but am completely open to offers and am not unreasonable or unrealistic and would consider any offer you may present. Please do come take a look at her, she likes visitors and doesn't bite. I don't appreciate spammer/scammers, and I don't need help selling it unless you have a friend or family member that could be interested. Thanks.
