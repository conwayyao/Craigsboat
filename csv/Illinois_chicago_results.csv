Hull is 100% complete just missing rigging and sails. This has been test floated (and passed with flying colors) but otherwise never seen water. The boat measures 18'6"" long  with a beam of 5'4"". Sadly the builder of this boat passed away just before completing the entire project and then it was put away, covered and stored in a climate controlled barn for a few year before emerging now. I got this boat with the intention of finishing and keeping her but I have found I just don't have the time at the moment and the last thing I want to see if this work of art waste away hidden in a barn until I do. The details and craftsmanship on this boat are without parallel. Everything is tight, symmetrical, sound, and beautiful! Pictures really do not do this boat justice but if you see it in the sunlight and see the mahogany gleaming deep, you will fall in love as I did. I spoke with the supplier of plans and kits for these boats and he stated that they sell bare hulls (no finish, no paint, no seats, no rudder or centerboard, no rigging or sails) for $6,500-$8000+.  This boat has a lot of the finishing work done already and it's been done very well! The trailer has never seen water. It was purchased at RA Adams in McHenry, IL, drove to Sleepy Hollow, IL and now to Crystal Lake, IL. All total, this trailer probably has less than 100 miles on it! It is a 2000 ShoreLand'r Hustler, with adjustable everything. Everything works, tires, again, have less that 100 miles on them and this trailer new cost around $2000. Title is free and clear and will be provided with purchase. At this time I am not looking to sell just the trailer but I would consider selling just the boat if necessary. Please contact me with any questions as well as to set up an appointment to see it in person. I guarantee you will want to see this. And if you do, you will want to take her home!

Rare to find in the US market, the Evoke is a great boat day paddles, fitness paddles and short overnight trips. The boat is awesome on flatwater, has great stability and I've had it in 6' waves and it handles like a rockstar - a truly versatile design!! When setting out to design the Pace series, Tiderace aimed to create innovative hulls which hit the mark for paddlers of all sizes and abilities. The Pace Evoke brings world class rough water handing and light touring in a compact ruddered format to sit nicely at the professional end of the recreation market. Built for smaller paddlers who want a versatile sea kayak and hate being anywhere but the front of the pack, the Pace Evoke's hull speed rivals most traditional sea kayaks. The compact boat format saves weight and makes full use of the waterline length while the four hatch layout, signature cockpit and expedition quality fittings mean the only thing the Evoke is short on is drag. This boat currently retails at $4400 so $2800 is a steal for this boat which is in like new condition.

I painted the outside twice, sealed it , totally redid the bow in harp cedar and sealed with silicone between each board and all the way around. I applied several coats of polyurethane after staining all the mahogany. Very rare.. I have half a dozen seats.  It sleeps two people and has top hatch door and side sliding glass window in the cabin. It does have some rib rot in the center of the boat.
