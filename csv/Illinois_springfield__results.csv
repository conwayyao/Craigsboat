Very low hours, always garage kept, and for a boat it gets very good fuel economy. Tank is built in, I think 11.5 gallons is the capacity. The cd player is a pioneer super tuner, works very well. I still have the owners manual and lots of extras to go with; 3 adult life jackets 3 child size life jackets and 1 infant, one monsoon tube and 3 pulling ropes. Also included is the cover, but I rarely use it being my garage is heated and cooled, and I always store it in there during winter.
