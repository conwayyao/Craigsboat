It seems to be great on fuel. The boat has a new Autocraft battery from Advance, with I think a 3 year warranty. The interior is in what I think to be really good shape for a 1985, the only tear in the vinyl is on the rear flat seat over the engine. The front seats have new boxes under them. I have also installed a ""cigarette lighter"" charging port on the dash for phones and other things. The trailer is a Calkins brand, with new wiring and lights. It pulls extremely well in the hills between Nashville and Lake Monroe. My wife and I purchased this boat in the spring, but after only going out on it a handful of times, realized a boat is not for us. The boat and the trailer both have clean and clear titles, in my name. The price is somewhat negotiable, however, I will only take the boat for a test drive at full asking price.
