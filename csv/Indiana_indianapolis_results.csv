Our plans have changed and the boat is for sale.As I stated the boat is in good condition but still needs some attention. The boat will need canvas the bottom paint finished and a few minor items fixed.I will sell the boat for 8,150 without trailer.I will sell it with trailer for 10,650.The trailer is a 2004 Performance in very good condition.The trailer is probably a little small for the boat if you were going to trailer full time, if you were going to use it twice a year to transport to lake it would do fine.I towed it 300 miles when I purchased it. This is a very roomy boat for being only 28' long.The boat is powered by a single Crusader 454 direct drive inboard.Call with questions.Possible partial trade. Review: Every manufacturer seems to have key luck with some of its selected models. For its part, Carver certainly did well with the 28-foot Riviera during its production run in the 1980s. It is a compact family cruiser whose relatively affordable price and unique two-cabin layout, struck a responsive cord with many boaters. I remember these boats being so popular that it wasn't uncommon to see several of them moored in close proximity to one other. We recently checked out a 1986 model. Built on a solid fiberglass hull, this unique model features an open-air center cockpit. The wraparound windshield offers great visibility and the large side windows offer great cross ventilation. The canvas top can also be easily removed; this can even be one in two separate sections for ultimate versatility. The port side of the cockpit features a cockpit table, which can be converted to a small, yet functional, berth when not in use. A handy movable backrest allows four to sit around the table and reveals a large passenger seat up forward when flipped to the aft position. Just ahead of the passenger seat is a large storage locker that doubles as a dry bar. Below the raised seat, you'll find plenty of additional storage for large items such as fenders and safety gear. Off to starboard, the helm area features a functional dash with plenty of room to flush and surface-mount electronics. The helm seat is quite large and below it you will even find more storage space. The forward cabin of the Riviera is quite spacious and offers ample headroom throughout. The galley to starboard features an alcohol/electric stove, built-in overhead toaster over, under-counter refrigerator, and ample counter and storage space. To port, there is a roomy head compartment, which again offers lots of headroom and a comfortable amount of space. A large U-shaped dinette encompasses the forward part of the main cabin and the high/low table converts this area to a very spacious berth. Additional sleeping accommodation can be found in the aft cabin, which features its own private entrance from the aft area of the cockpit. Here you'll find a single berth to starboard and a double berth to port. Also featured is a large storage locker between the beds, complete with mirrored doors and a vanity sink.",,5900500407,40.535900,28,-85.661600,,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@40.535900,-85.661600,16z",,$8050,power," (Marion,IN)",1985 Carver 2807 Carver Riviera,https://indianapolis.craigslist.org/boa/5900500407.html,

With about 4 people in the boat and the ballast full, the wake is almost too big so it doesn't take much. Being an experienced rider, I considered upgrading the ballast but there really isn't a need. I've been in a lot of newer wake boats that don't throw a wake this nice. I have stored the boat in a garage the last 3 years. I clean and oil the teak every season. Currently, the boat is winterized and at storage for the winter. I may be able to have the owner of the building pull it out (only for serious inquires). Typically you can't get the boat out until April. Reason for lots of pictures. I added the JL stereo, and added two speakers to the bow of the boat as the older Centurions didn't come with them from the factory. Stereo is also insanely loud. Three volume knobs were added to zone out the stereo. Zones for the tower, subs, and boat speakers. Boat always gets Mother's Marine Spray wax when taking out of the lake (trailer gets wiped down too). I get a lot of great comments on this boat for its condition and its year. Rub Rail has some marks and the boat also does too. It's an 04 so there are a few blemishes. A lot of these blemishes were already on the boat when I purchased it. I also have documentation of the service work that has been done to it. Serious inquires only please. Contact me for more pictures. Thank you.

With the help of Raimi Merritt, they have created just the board. The Hyperlite Maiden Wakeboard features a continuous rocker that lays the foundation for a fast board that carves and edges with ease. The Maiden features innovative Tapered Channels that narrow at the tip and tail, aligning the Dual Fin Configuration to increase the board's edge hold on approach to the wake. This helps to deliver a pop off the wake like no other for any approach style. The thinner profile of the board and reduced tip and tail width minimize swing weight for simple rotation on flat and inverted spins. Combine all of this with Hyperlite's women's-specific Satin flex and Dual Molded Landing features, and you have a deck perfect for a female ripper. Rocker Type Continuous Rocker - Smooth, fast and predictable ride for soft landings Hull Tapered fin and channel alignment Dual landing spines Rails/Edges Variable edge profile Core Biolite 3 Core - The secret recipe Hyperlite has been perfecting since day one. This core material is the gold standard in the industry and used throughout their line. Bio 3 is Hyperlite's lightest and most durable formula to date.

She ticks all the right boxes - she's a two owner boat, American built, in freshwater all her life, stored and winterized at Larsen Marine. New transmission in 2010 and barely used since. Reupholstered cushions throughout. Big and safe and comfortable inside and out. Her modified full keel offers a great balance of performance and stability. She's got good sails, a good engine, good standing rigging. Her good looks will turn heads at the dock and under way. And then there is the price, $19900, which is a guideline only!
