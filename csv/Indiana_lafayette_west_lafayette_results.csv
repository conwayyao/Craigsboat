Mercruiser Alpha One Drive unit. With a newer Shoreland'r boxed rail trailer. Runs great tops out around 45 mph. 20ft long. A really clean boat for its age. I have had it for 5 years, I just don't have the spare time to use it and it is to nice of a boat just to sit. This would make a very nice starter boat for little money. In the last couple years I have installed a new lower unit water pump, ign module, dist cap, rotor, pick-up sensor, plug wires, fuel pump and two rear speakers and rebuilt the carb. The boat has a AM FM CD player, a top for shade and cover. AWESOME BOAT. Also comes with spare tire and hard shell nose cover. When I bought the boat 5 years ago the owner had repaired a crack in the block which still has a slow water drip from it but does not effect the running of the boat.
