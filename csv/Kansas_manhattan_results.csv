Live well (not aerated) 3seats Bilge pump 2 anchors with rope, spare paddle, 2-3life jackets Hunting blind- I have 2camo nets but would need more brush. I designed it so one could zip tie new brush on and it needs the door fastened on. Only problem with the boat is it does have a slow leak. It never really bothered me as I just turned on the bilge pump when needed. Overall this boat is a great rig for fishing and can be a great rig for hunting I just never finished it. I have some lights that could be installed too. I've had this boat on many lakes including Milford and caught lots of fish out of it. But I have to move out of state and I ultimately will be getting a bigger one to hold 4+ people.

It also has a live well but may need some work to replace old wood. I have two motors for it: 1965 90HP Johnson (needs mechanical shifter) and 1972 100HP Johnson (lots of newer parts but blown cylinder).  Kicker is I want to keep the trailer, so you can have boat and motors but not the trailer. The boat is in pretty good condition for its age.  I have a new rack and pinion steering installed and a new stainless steering wheel that goes with boat.  I also have a setup for a second battery installed if wanted. Would be a pretty fun project boat.  It's a great boat for big lake fishing due to the aluminum V bottom since it sits high on the water and cuts through the waves.  It would be tough to capsize her.  I decided to buy a Lund so am trying to send her to a new home. I can deliver it on the trailer to you but we'll have to pull it off the trailer for storage with you, since I plan to keep the trailer.  You will have to let me know if you want the motors since I'm inquiring of some vintage motor dealers to see if they may want them.  Lots of good parts in the motors and both could be fired up with some work.  1965 90HP was a good motor and only needs a mechanical shifter.  1972 100HP Johnson has lots of new parts but needs to be rebuilt due to blown cylinder.

Runs good, outdrive functions as it should.  Hull is in good shape.  Interior needs redone but is usable.  Comes with a snap on bow cover for the front.  Has a bimini top but it needs some work.  It has plastic windows in it and they have gotten yellow and brittle.  Could either take them out or replace them with new plastic.  Trailer has a good set of tires on it and works as it should. The engine in the boat is an automotive engine.  I bought the boat with a locked up engine and installed this one in it.  It has brass freeze plugs throughout, new oil pump, new marine starter, new rear main seal, new oil pan gasket, one new exhaust manifold, new plugs and wires, new marine distributor cap, new marine electric fuel pump running off a relay and oil pressure switch (no oil pressure the fuel pump won't run).  The outdrive has been serviced and has a new exhaust bellows and the lower unit has a new water pump and shaft seals. The boat still needs a couple little things to be ready to go, but could be on the water within a day.  Blower duct work is broken and needs replaced.  Trailer lights need looked at.  Ground wire appears to be broken so they do not work at this time.  Shifter cable needs adjusted. Has a hard time finding neutral. Prop has a vibration. Have multiple props that go with it but they are all damaged to some extent.  Best as I can tell everything else on the boat works as it should.  Nav. lights, bilge, blower, anchor lights, cabin lights, gauges seem to operate properly (tach works when it wants to).  Cheap way to get on the water before the holiday.
