12,good,"['38.820600', '-95.687100']",2016-12-14 20:36,Super fun boat that is perfect for a family that enjoys a variety of water sports. The boat has a 120HP XR jet engine and makes a perfect fishing boat with no prop to raise or lower in shallow water. The deck is designed to hold a chair (not sold with this boat) that can be mounted in a hole. It has lights to be mounted for night time fishing. The bow of the boat seat covers turn over for indoor outdoor carpeting making it easy to clean. On the fun side for the kids the boat does an impressive 35-50mph depending on the number of people in it (weight). It handles much like a jet ski and makes some fun turns at high speeds. I've pulled skiers and the kids enjoy hours of being drug around on the tube. For comfort the bow seats can be turned over for a soft vinyl padding. Just had it in the shop this past summer to have a new steering cable put it and spent quite a few weekends on the lake and installation of a brand new sump pump. We bought it from a family 2 years ago who had bought it from Florida. It has some seat wear and tear but nothing significant. It could used to be scrubbed to remove some of the water stains but nothing that makes the boat less fun. Trailer and tires are in EXCELLENT shape! Comes with some life vests and fire extinguishers. I just finished nursing school and my family is looking to move out of state. We don't want to take this boat with us. I paid 3500 for it so you'll be getting a great deal as I've seen them online for this same price range.

44,,"['38.418400', '-96.187100']",2016-11-29 19:10,"Hello, for sale is my VIP Vindicator, 23 foot sport cuddy powerboat. It has a custom wrap, nice trailer with newer tires, has a nice head deck and comes with (6) of the best 6.5"" marine speakers that money can buy. Has a new bimini top. Interior is in decent condition. And the best part about it, is it has a brand spanking new motor, from oil pan to intake (Long Block). This motor is a 5.7 liter mercruiser magnum with flat top pistons, big marine cam, roller lifters, roller rockers, edelbrock performance intake, Holley 750 CFM carb, thru hull exhaust, new drive u-joint, new exhaust and shift bellows, new gimbal bearing, all new gasket on outdrive, complete outdrive service. Lakeside Marine in Topeka put the motor in, While they had the motor out, i had them go over everything else and fix anything they felt neccesary. The motor mounts were moist so they sent the boat over to their fiberglass shop and put new motor mounts in. Has a new blower, brand new 23 pitch prop. I know i am forgetting stuff. Put it this way, i spent 6000$ at the shop and i have receipts for EVERYTHING and there is a warranty on the motor, heads and the engine install and alignment. This is a great deal for the $$$. I am not forced to sell this boat, and if i have to hang onto it until spring. I will be asking a bunch more. I have a brand new in the boxes, 4000 watt stereo system that is ready to install down to the box that i can add into the deal for an extra 1500$. The system cost me just under 3 grand and like i said, all brand new still in the boxes. 2 Kicker L7 square sub, mono amp, zapco 650x6 amp for mids and highs, EQ, wiring kit, extra batteries, perko switch etc. I also have a custom box for the subs that goes under the back seat that is tuned to 40hz, the exact amount of air space for a sealed box for these subs. The wrap is in good shape and so is the rest of the fiberglass. The cuddy is in decent condition and has a spot for a bed and there is a spot under the bed for a slide out porta potty. there is a door that opens and closes to make the cuddy a private area. I also have a 19 pitch prop that goes with the boat in case a person would like to do some serious wake boarding and or tubing. I would imagine i could pull 3 tubes with ease. The boat will do over 60 mph with 23 pitch prop. Only thing that needs attention and i may have fixed before sale is the RPM gauge needs replaced ( doesn't work but is only the gauge that needs replaced, boat shop tested it, i was thinking about getting all new gauges so i opted for them not to replace it). Also, the oil pressure gauge works and then stops. The gauge is going bad and will need replaced, as with the RPM gauge, i told them now to replace it because i planned on getting a entire gauge set. I had plans to buy a wake board tower for this boat and put some K plane trim tabs on it but i bought another boat that i want to concentrate on. This is a sweet boat and in very good shape for an 89. The fiberglass on this thing is over 4"" thick and is a very well made boat, and now that is has a new drive train and a clean bill of health, it will last for a very long time without any major repairs. Engine and work done has a 1 year warranty. Motor was built my Rapid Marine in Miami Fl and shipped here. The outdrive also had a gear reduction and stronger shafts put in it as i planned on going bigger on the mods than i did with the motor. it is ready to hit the lake!! Please feel free to call or text me with any questions concerning the details or purchase of this boat at show contact info I can take it out to Melvern for a test drive for serious buyers with cash in hand. Thanks for looking. BTW, a nice wakeboard tower for this boat can be purchased for around 2k. The boat kicks up a pretty nice wake.
