This boat looks immacullant it has always been stored indoors and has very little run time on it. It also sets on a factory skeeter trailer with a swing away tongue and the tires are like brand new. I haven't used the boat enough to justify keeping it. It has also just been serviced by Barry's Westside Marine (the best in town) it's ready to go to the lake. Thanks to the previous buyer who wanted to have it checked out and left me with the bill and the boat. I guarantee you won't find a nicer boat for the money and it's under book value. It also has brand new hummingbird gps graph and fish finders on it and a minnkota 3 bank trickle charger and 55lb thrust minnkota all terrain trolling motor. It also has double live wells, built in cooler, built in CD player w/ speakers, ski pylon, 3 different skis, knee board, and a brand new tube in the box and so much more. The boat, motor and trailer all have a open title to them.
