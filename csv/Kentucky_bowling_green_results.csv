Metal hull with a deck over design that's great for bow fishing and frog gigging. 6 blade prop, very strong with a lot of pushing power. Will run on dry land and runs perfect in shallow water. Matching trailer goes with it. I bought the boat when I was living in FL and it was great fun, but when I I moved back to ky I had no one to ride with so I parked it inside and it hasnt been out since I moved back to ky in 14. It's just sitting in my dad's tool shed taking up space so it needs to go. I haven't cranked it this year bc the battery is shot and I drained all the fuel out. It ran perfect the last time I ran it and it has been stored inside so it's just a little dusty. I will make someone a deal on this boat just to get it out of my dad's way. I paid $8000 for it in 09, I'll take a loss just bc I haven't cranked it and don't intend to pull it out and clean carb, battery, fuel and all that. It is here for anyone's inspection. I'm going to try it on here for a couple weeks and if it doesn't sell I'll put it on southernairboats.com and it will sell fast. I just hate the idea of having to deliver it to FL. Please do not contact me if you are not serious or don't have the money. My asking price is pretty firm but will wiggle a little if someone is serious. I don't have time to bs about airboats and how cool they are. If your serious hmu and I'll make it yours!!
