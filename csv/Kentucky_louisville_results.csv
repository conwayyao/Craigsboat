Custom Collapsible Solid Wake tower. Sits on an almost new condition 2009 Trailer. Tires in good condition. Has the Swing away Tongue and collapsible tower to allow it to fit in many garages.

The only real flaws is one small little chip/scratch on right side front, but very minor. Has a very nice swim platform and filler cushions to make a nice sunning area. This boat includes an OEM factory internal ballast system operated with the touch of a button to give you an additional 750 lbs of internal ballast to make a monstrous wake great for wakeboarding, Wake surfing, or knee boarding. No unsightly ""fatsaks"" to lay across your deck to add more weight. Also has the $2000 Perfect Option installed to allow precision control of your speed no mater what water sports you enjoy. Let me just say if your intent for this boat is for water sports (and it should be), then Perfect Pass is a Must! I could never go back to a boat that doesn't have it. Maintains an accurate GPS speed that you preset for whatever activity you are doing behind the boat. Has the bigger 160 HP High Output twin engines for a total of 320 HP. Planes off quick! Top Speed of 53 mph. Pulls a 220 lb Slalom Skier right up out of the water, so you know it has the power to Wakeboard, Kneeboard, Tube or anything else you want to do. Also has simple one touch button for ""No Wake Mode"" to get you out of the no wake zones faster, while still making no wake. Has a nice swim platform makes the perfect place to enjoy that kind of a day. There's a mount for the cockpit table, so you can enjoy refreshments at the water's edge, and a remote for the stereo is within reach from the water. Has waterproof Sony AM/FM/CD Stereo equipped with 4 Kicker speakers and a cool little compartment with an input for your MP3 Player or Iphone. Has a shallow 16"" draft so you can go just about anywhere and be king to plants and animal life.

I installed a fuel pump in order to get rid of the pressurized gas tank that was required to run it.  But you don't have to worry about that old pressure tank, just hook it up to your regular gas tank and you're good to go.  The mounting bracket is cracked but it never gave me a problem, just squeeze down on the knobs to secure it.  The reverse gear works, front gear works, pumps water perfectly.
