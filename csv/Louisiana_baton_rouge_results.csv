Overall length 22', Beam 8'-6"". 72-gallon fuel tank. It has the draft of a bay boat and can accept a bow-mounted trolling motor, but with a higher freeboard and a closed transom, this bay boat performs better offshore than any other boat in its class. The high-performance hull design is rock-solid while running and at rest. This versatile boat can fish freshwater lakes, saltwater estuaries, inlets, bays and offshore. The roomy cockpit is larger than most 24' boats and has lockable rod storage for 10 outfits (including your 9' fly rods). Dual livewells, aft, keep bait frisky and easily accessible. The bow casting platform features two large fiberglass hatches that open to an impressive amount of room for your dry storage needs. The entire front of the center console lifts with enough room for a head. Innovative helm seating includes custom upholstered seats that conform to your body and allow you to drive comfortably from a seated position. No need to stand all day to operate your boat. The stern has a cushioned couch. This boat is constructed with exceptional attention to every detail, something that you can only get from a boat manufacturer that builds each boat one at a time, custom rigged, to the owner's specifications. This package includes a new tandem axle aluminum trailer and a 200 hp Evinrude G2 with 6 years of warranty, plus a 4 blade SS prop. Cruise at 36 MPH getting 4.8 MPG or hit 52 MPH and still get 2.8 MPG. Retail price as rigged is over 50K, this boat can be bought for 46,800.

The only reason it is being sold is that I have made the plunge to a peddle drive system... I I got the new Predator PDL. The hull had typical rash and dinks, that I have cleaned up and smoothed back out per manufacturer?s instructions. I have also included a brand new skid plate.
