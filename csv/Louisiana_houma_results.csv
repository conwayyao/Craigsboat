The work was done by a certified Yamaha mechanic; he has rebuilt two other motors for me and they were trouble free. The water impeller was also replaced. I bumped a tree with the back left corner and caused some minor damage. (See picture) There are some drill hole on the boat from previous installations also there are some chips and dings form normal wear. The boat has been well maintained and in good shape. I have had the boat for four years and I keep it under a shed. I only run non-ethanol gas in the motor. It has a Minnkota trolling motor, 24 volt, 74 lb. thrust and an onboard charger. All the pumps and lights work. The fuel gauge works but the other gauges do not. The boat has a 60 gallon fuel tank. The trailer is well used but well maintained . The trailer does have some rust. I just replaced the axles and the hubs have bearing buddies. The tires look good but they are several years old. I do put it on I-10 for a road trip to Louisiana occasionally with no problems.
