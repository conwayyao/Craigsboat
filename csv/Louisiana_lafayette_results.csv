It has been used less than 10 times. The reason I am selling it is because I just had back surgery and will not be able to use it for at least 6 months. It is in great condition. No cracks, and very little rash. I mean very little. I have added some mods: 1) YakAttack Kayak LeverLock Deluxe Anchor Trolley AMS-1003 ($35.00) 2) Center Console Hinge Kit with Gas Strut (not installed, but easy to do so). This will automatically raise the center console rather than having you remove the top each time. ($70). 3) I made the center console measurement markings silver to better see. The original paddle, hatches, seat, and rear cargo bungee are included, just as you would purchase it new. Total invested: $1,100.00 + Asking: $800.00 Please text or call if interested. I am located in Lafayette. Due to my back issue, I am unable to deliver, so I ask that you pick it up from my house.
