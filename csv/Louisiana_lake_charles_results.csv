( the main shaft & rudder stuffing boxes serviced with the new cord) 2500 watt inverter install and wired in with handheld remote power switch ( we were thinking ice maker, but we got a counter top one that works great) 11 gallon hot water heater works well aso ( motion sensor Led's installed in both heads) Dingy is a Walker bay 10ft sail boat ( no eng yet) but I have all the sails and riggings, and two new alum. oars) extra floats are attached and hold air evenly. ( not nedded, but makes her easy to get in and out of) two if the 3 battery banks have just been replaced with 6 brand new deep cycle batteries wired in series 12V each bank ( and installed in their own battery boxes) New ip67 water and shock froof battery charger installed ( it runs a diagnostic in all 3 banks of you batteries ( will even tell you if the connections are poor !)

( storage is everwere and I have 2 of almost everything) The auto pilot is a deam, It take me 1hr to get out of the canal to the lake (then shoot the chanel and dodge all the newly placed crab traps, another 30 min) using the ( hold course is just one button) she makes up for wind and current and keeps you on a straight line. ( Our Gests alway stare in amaizment when I tell her to take me home) She will reverse course and follow the exact same path ( or any one auto stored) and take me all the way back! ( I do not touch the wheel for 1h and 20 min untill I get to the small draw bridge.  There is way to many great things about this boat to list and I know I am frogeting a lot about her, You need to see her in person...... She is impressive to say the least.  I will add what comes to me.... ( lower helm steering seals I replace one year ago) they are both stainless steel boxes with new fluid and brass fittings ( sterring is very responsive and manual) and hydrolic, (not the junky chain type)  the autopilot is eletric/hydrolic. ( right above the main solon is all new blue LED waterproof lights, see Pic's,  Look great for an eavning cruse ( lights up the walk around deck, and you will be seen by trafic) Only a 1 to 1.5 volt drop with every light on her turned on and all eletronics !  Led is the way to go !  last weekend  we cleaned the brackish Moustache off of her ( and sealed the glass) I have a pic of the before and after, I will put it in if I have room. Why in the hell am I selling this awsome boat !  The answer is Time :(   In 9.8 years we can retire ( I PRAY) the fuel burn is great !  but the 7.5 mph is killing us. Right after the tank inspection we filled her up ( and treated with the best on the market) Weekend BBQ and sleep overs have been Great!  We run her almost every week end and a few 10 hour trips to Clear water has been great. Almost 2 years of weekend warrior running and we still have right under 3/4 tanks of fuel left in both. We need something a little faster, our slip is only $100.00 a month in a real secure aera , but on sight and beach play time is really short. So partial trades for a smaller express cruser are more than welcome and an option to purchase her back in nine years or so would also be great!   She has had nothing but T.L.C. and she deserves no less.....
