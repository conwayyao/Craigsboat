This boat is the ultimate predator on the water. The blistering holeshot, blazing top-end speed, exhilarating handling, and the unmatched smooth, dry ride truly form the 211 into a prodigious athlete on the water; but the benefits don't stop with the hull. With the trolling motor down and two guys up front, the broad deck of the 211 offers an oversized platform that is rock-solid and incredibly stable even in the roughest water. The efficient and functional layout makes every aspect of the fishing experience seem natural from the moment you step into the boat. From the perfectly positioned bow panel that accommodates up to 9"" electronics to the solid-state touchpad controls, recessed trolling motor foot pedal, padded front deck step, exclusive Tournament Day Box, and passenger rod storage system, the Alpha 211 puts everything at your fingertips, and does it in ultra-sleek style and with unmatched strength and durability. It's that smooth look and solid build that sets a Legend apart from the rest. Continuing with our efficiency in design, the deck layout on the Alpha 211 is just that. We've got 3 three oversized storage boxes on the front deck, and two on the rear with under-seat storage, coolers, livewells, and glove boxes in between. You won't find ten different lids separating all of your tackle on this boat. Our simple layout lets you open a single box and know that what you're looking for is right there¦ no searching necessary. And the center tackle storage is easy to organize with our QuickStick spring-loaded support that secures your tackle where it needs to be, the way you want it organized. Rod organization is exactly that as well. The standard organizer has individual tubes and locations for 14 combos, and is laid out in such a way that they sit securely in place and are effortlessly accessible when you need them. You won't find your rods stacked and tangled after a long ride in rough water with our system. And in addition to all of this, the Alpha 211 is a flat-out fishing machine with it's massive decks, unmatched handling, and cheek-flapping top-end speed, making this a ride more than worthy of it's Alpha name. And the velvety smooth rough water ride this hull is known for, well, that's something you've got to experience to understand. Draft: 1 ft. 3 in. Beam: 7 ft. 10 in.
