Like new 24 Volt trolling motor 82lb Minn Kota. (says 101 36V on label my trolling motor man converted it as no room for more batteries) works great and has hydraulic lift assist with cable and large handle for release (much better than old rope set up) New LED courtesy lights New fuel sender (controls fuel gauge) New Custom boat cover ($650) Trailer: New Spare tire Year old tires on the ground New LED lights New Bunk boards New bow roller I am probably forgetting some things, please call if any questions.  I know this boat is listed higher than NADA value.  The price reflects all the new parts on this great Champion boat.  These boats have excellent performance, handling, and ride. Lake test available for serious buyer. This boat does not have fish finders.  I am willing to install fish finders if buyer provides the units. Asking $10,500.  Titles in hand, no trades, no scammers, local pick only, cash only. Thanks for looking!!
