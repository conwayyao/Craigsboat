The canoe also works as a big solo canoe. It is currently outfitted for OC2. The boat makes a great OC2 slalom race boat; it would also be excellent as a tandem river-runner, if the team had the boat control to not bash into rocks. I can not really recommend using it as a solo boat, unless you have some special purpose in mind (e.g., you are a solo 250# paddler, or you are running the Grand Canyon self-supported, or ...). Neither can I recommend it if your so-called ""paddling style"" is to careen down rivers bashing into this and that. This boat is fully outfitted and ready to paddle after you make some modest repairs. The previous owners were rock bashers...there are quite a number of patches. The patches were mostly done by a professional...not the boat-owning rock-bashers. There are also some damaged areas, from the previous owners, which have not been patched. We are not rock-bashers and were paddling the boat, as it is. But, it would be way better to fix it before paddling it. It has been stored inside, and is nice and dry (ready to patch).

Solid build that would survey well. Very good in heavy air and shallow water. Never used the spinnaker. 26' overall with boom kin. 25"" draft board up, 4' down ( fiberglass).
