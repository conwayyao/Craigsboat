The boat was totally re-powered in 2005 with a mere. cared 5.0 and a Bravo one outdrive. The boat has been flawless ever since. The boat however does need an interior re-fit. The boat has an enclosed head which works fine. The older deck style of this boa makes it much more friendly to fishing than the current models. The true value of this boat are in the mechanics. The boat runs perfectly, so if your not afraid to put some cosmetic love into a boat that you can totally use duriing the process then this is the boat for you. The boat is very easy to single hand for fishing which is how it has been used for many years now. The boat does not have an hour meter so I don't know how many hours are on the motor but I suspect somewhere between 600 and a  1000.",,5921772616,38.914900,24,-76.542400,Bayliner,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@38.914900,-76.542400,16z",Cierra Sunbridge 2450,$3800,power," (Edgewater, MD)",1989 Bayliner Cierra Sunbridge 2450,https://annapolis.craigslist.org/boa/5921772616.html,1989
