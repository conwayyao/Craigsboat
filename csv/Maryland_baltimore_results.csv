Let me start off by saying I absolutely love this boat! It will get you up in the shallow  rivers to your favorite bass spots, down the Monocacy to your favorite big-cat honey holes, or out in the Chesapeake as you glide thru the chop chasing big Rock fish. This I know, but with a family of growing kids comes a need for a larger boat. Let's get started with all the fun stuff... -hull is a '09 Tracker with no repairs, dents or holes ever! -trailer is a '09 Trailstar with no issues or accidents ever! -motor is a '14 Merc efi 50hp 4-stroke with about 20 hours on it (bought new w/ all papers and receipts) and I believe it is on a 5 year manufacture warranty from time of purchase -motor was also upgraded to the Merc Spitfire 4 blade prop -I have new LED brake lights for trailer (not yet installed) -trailer has a new Fulton all-aluminum heavy duty jack -trailer also has brand new aluminum wheels w/ GoodYear tires (less than 100mi) -Hummingbird 597ci HD finder with GPS and down imaging -all aluminum rod tower that has 6 rod holders on it -self adjusting trim tabs (keep boat on plane no matter speed) -dual Optima BlueTop batteries (1 cranking, 1 accessories) -ProSport dual bank batter charging and balancing system -fire extinguisher under console -front seat cup/accessories holders -heavy duty cleats all around boat (2 front, 2 rear) -Mag Light holder on console (no more looking for it in dark) -custom LED transom light on top of rod tower -custom flush mount bow light -there are also 7 additional rod holders around the rails (3 bow, 4 side) This great boat has so much to offer (as you can see from above) but I just have too much family these days. The bow of the boat has a trolling motor plug, two large storage compartments for all your needs, and a live-well. There is a large side box with plenty of storage for all your rods, paddles, tackle, ect... There is also compartment on the back deck where the two top of the line Optima batteries live. There is one seat mount on the nose, two seat mounts on the floor and another single seat mount on rear deck. I will include 3 seats with the boat (2 Tracker seats, 1 BassPro folding) but I only have the two posts in pictures. The seats are a bit sun-dried on top of the seat backs, but that is the only bad thing on entire boat! I do have a bunch of river anchors, new rope, life jackets and other accessories that can be included depending upon our final selling price. As you can see, there is a lot of money, hi end parts and great things about this boat that make it truly a pleasure to fish from and just comfortable in every aspect. I am not in any type of rush or money problems that are making me sell this beauty, so I have zero interest in stupid offers... Please don't waste my time!
