Both skis had the carbs rebuilt, last used in October 2014 and ran great. They were winterized for the winter of 2014-2015. Dewinterized for vacation in the fall of 2015, however never got a chance to use them. At that time I noticed excessive oil, not smoke, coming from the exhaust of the SPX. I was told at that time that the SPX would need a new motor. Both skis were winterized for the winter of 2015-2016. The 1994 XP was started in late summer this year, the SPX is still winterized. I was going to put a motor in the SPX, however I purchased another pair of skis. These skis have not been in the water since 2014. Both skis are currently winterized. The bottom line is as far as I know the XP should be good to go, the SPX needs work, possibly a motor. Both skis show their age and could use a good cleaning. Both hulls remained dry when they were last used. Please feel free to ask any questions or if you would like to see them. They are located in Owings, Maryland.

Large, port and starboard, cat-eye windows and sharply angled windows forward pour an abundance of natural light into the salon. The interior, so bright and airy, is also spacious. The mid-cabin (usually reserved for children or storage), is large enough to be the master stateroom. Bathed in natural light from forward and side, the interior of the 3060 compares in size and amenities to many larger cruisers.  A comfortable dining area converts quickly to large queen-size sleeping quarters. A full galley includes a microwave oven, double burner stove, and ample refrigeration. The 3060 has Regal's innovative Cockpit Forward Seating arrangement. The main seating group is located adjacent to the helm, not in the rear. Everyone rides up front with the captain and shares the helm station view. The helm seat swivels to face the group for better socializing and, with a simple adjustment, the cockpit table slides into ideal position between group and helm. Cockpit table is removable.
