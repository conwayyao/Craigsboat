The engine is in great shape, straight 4 cylinder, carb just rebuilt, very powerful for skiing. The gas line terminus in the bottom of the tank was corroded and recently replaced. Sadly, the rear seals began to leak, and I took it to Klaves Marina and it will take $521.56 in parts to fix. They quoted labor of $945. Estimate attached. They left it apart, with all parts ready to be reassembled. The boat is in a garage and can be inspected by appointment. The trailer is in very good condition, just purchased used for $700. The service manager at Klaves said that the engine alone is worth $1800. I was told the boat is worth $2000-$2500 if it were running. Negotiable is a second trailer (EZ loader) that needs $60 in parts to be back in service.

Selling a 20 ft Stingray with an I/O and the 350 chevy.  boat has thru the hull exhaust and sounded great when it was running.  Selling because i just am not using it as much any more and have been going out on my friends boats. Did not get taken out at all this year.  boat was running about 50 and feels pretty good in the water but I think with the right engine in it it should be able to do in the 60's. It will need an engine. oil pressure is  low and was getting lower each time i took it out but there are no knocks. last time i tried to start the boat a couple of months ago would not start.  will need a carb rebuild or a new carburator. I got this from a buddy just after he blew up the previous engine.  he had a block laying around and threw the engine together that is currently in it.  the engine does have edelbrock aluminum heads on it not sure which ones. out drive would become hard to shift after you were out for a little bit, when i would get home i would open the drain screw and some water would come out, so i think a seal was bad and it was creating too much pressure in the lower end to allow easy shifting. It will not come with a battery. interior is in need of attention as you can see in the pics.  the trailer does have good tires on it and goes down the road fine.any questions please feel free to ask and thanks for looking.  if you are not able to fix this yourself this is probably not the boat for you. i feel boats like this in good condition will sell for about 5k or better. stainless prop and life jackets are not included with the boat. if this add is still here the boat is still for sale",,5915502442,,20,,,,,$1300,power, (SALINE),1990 STINGRAY MAXIM PROJECT,https://annarbor.craigslist.org/boa/5915502442.html,
