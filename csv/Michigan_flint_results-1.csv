Tyler Crockett racing marine engine with 700 horse power and 700 lbs. of torque on pump gas (full specs and dyno sheets available). The hull has 409 hours and 13 on the new engine. As for the engine, it starts with a Dart big M block, Brodix heads and intake, ARP Bolts and studs, Eagle racing crank and rods, ceramic coated pistons, Jesel valve train, Pro systems custom carburetor, Custom CMI big tube headers, tailpipes and mufflers, 15 qt oil pan, MSD ignition and much more. It is balanced and blueprinted. Runs on pump gas with 9:1 compression ratio and turns 6,200 rpm's at W.O.T. The hull was also modified because Baja has a very pronounced hook in the back ( it forces the bow down to control the speed ) which was removed and re-gell coated. Thus, handling was improved at the speeds this boat runs. This is not a modified GM motor, it is a custom built racing engine, designed specifically for this boat. Additional specs include k-planes tabs with indicators; bolster seats, 3,000W stereo system with 4 amps. GPS, drive shower, Imco external steering cyl., Harden marine sea strainer with hull pickup, 115V power receptacles hard wired in, compass, snap in carpet and more. It also includes two covers (1 full with sides and cockpit). Bravo 1 HP drive turns a 28P Bravo 1 labeled prop. This a great every day cruiser for pulling kids on a tube or coasting down the river, but also has the ability to run 85 mph!

This sign is from Langs Marine that was on Lake Fenton in Fenton Michigan. Langs opened in 1943 and closed in the early 2000's.  This marina was a Lake Fenton fixture for over 50 years. A great loss when this marina closed. This sign hung in front of the marina for many years. We removed the old worn out and heavy high output fluorescent light fixture/ballast and replaced them with four modern LED 4' foot tubes. They last much longer (50,000 hours!), come on instantly, they are light, run cool, immune to cold temperatures and this fixture draws a TOTAL of 72 watts. A nice upgrade. We retained the original aluminum outer frame so it looks as it did circa 1963. The original fluorescent fixture had a steel sub frame inside the fixture. We built a new inner structure with lumber, screwed together with galvanized steel screws. Very solid and much lighter than it originally was.  We then added two hanging eyes on top. They are bolted through the 2X3""  structure on the top of the fixture and are made of 1/2"" diameter eye bolts. Very beefy. This sign is from a different time. A better time. Built for indoor or outdoor use. Run's on 110 AC volt house current with three prong (grounded) plug.
