This sign is from Langs Marine that was on Lake Fenton in Fenton Michigan. Langs opened in 1943 and closed in the early 2000's.  This marina was a Lake Fenton fixture for over 50 years. A great loss when this marina closed. This sign hung in front of the marina for many years. We removed the old worn out and heavy high output fluorescent light fixture/ballast and replaced them with four modern LED 4' foot tubes. They last much longer (50,000 hours!), come on instantly, they are light, run cool, immune to cold temperatures and this fixture draws a TOTAL of 72 watts. A nice upgrade. We retained the original aluminum outer frame so it looks as it did circa 1963. The original fluorescent fixture had a steel sub frame inside the fixture. We built a new inner structure with lumber, screwed together with galvanized steel screws. Very solid and much lighter than it originally was.  We then added two hanging eyes on top. They are bolted through the 2X3""  structure on the top of the fixture and are made of 1/2"" diameter eye bolts. Very beefy. This sign is from a different time. A better time. Built for indoor or outdoor use. Run's on 110 AC volt house current with three prong (grounded) plug.
