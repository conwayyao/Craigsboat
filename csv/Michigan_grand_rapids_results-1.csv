Going through a divorce and I'm being told its one of the things that has to go. 237 LS model with interior upgrades and cruise control. 76 hours on the boat - most of which were slow cruising hours. This boat is so comfortable we took this on our nightly slow-cruise around the lake with friends rather than taking the pontoon. Boat is in excellent shape. I removed the decals from the sides just for personal preference. I didnt like how busy it looked. I do have a replacement set of decals I just purchased that will come with the boat so if you want to apply them you can. I added forward and rearward facing LED lights. Makes docking at night a lot easier and the rearward are fun for night time swimming off the platform. I also professionally added a subwoofer and amp. Boat also has a brand new battery. Boat runs amazingly. Always been well taken care of. Kept on the covered boat lift during the summer. Stored on the trailer indoors during the winter. Nothing I can think of that is wrong with it...other than having to sell it. Was around $73,000 new about a year and a half ago. I am open to trades. I am looking for a less expensive open bow boat between 17' and 21' (Four Winns, Bayliner or equivalent). Prefer to stay model years 2000 and current unless its an older ski boat such as a Malibu or Mastercraft.
