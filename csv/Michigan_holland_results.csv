(which does not hold the motor mount, just the raft).  This raft can now be shipped safely should someone out of state want to pay for it plus shipping expenses. For sale, an Avon Redcrest inflatable dinghy.  I bought this Avon Redcrest last year for two reasons: 1.  My father has one but the transom (motor mount) was misplaced or lost by a previous owner (also a family member).  If nothing else, I can at least give the motor mount to him as a gift. 2.  I wanted an inflatable boat for my kids to be able to have fun in as they get older.  They're still toddlers now, but I was just a bit beyond this age when my father bought a Sea Eagle 6.  My brothers and I learned to handle the big Lake Michigan waves over the sandbars near shore in this craft (learning curve) and this set us up well as we learned to sail and ski. This boat is essentially a complete kit, and includes the raft / dinghy, the foot pump (needs the hose re-terminated but otherwise works), mid-section divider, fiberglass seat, cloth kit bag that the boat rolls up into, and possibly the transom.  The reason why I say ""possibly the transom"" is that I'll take $50 off the asking price if I can keep the transom / motor mount for my father.  The boat works fine as a rowboat or life raft without it, but you can use up to a 4 hp outboard motor on this craft if my memory serves me correctly by using the included transom and there are lots of Evinrude or Johnson 3 hp motors out there.  A Mercury super-sloper might be a bit on the heavy side.  Missing items: The factory patch kit, the factory folding oars (if this boat came with them). Why the low price?  Two reasons, and both of them require a small patch.  There is a puncture cut at the bow, just below the water line and another damage point amid-ships.  Both can be easily patched, but I don't have time for it right now.  I'm finishing work on a fix-er-upper house for my family and I that's gone way over budget and time and I need to sell off some non-essential items for funding to complete things like PEX pipe water supply lines, paint & drywall, kitchen repairs, and replacement windows as we can afford them. You can turn this inflatable boat into a RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boat) by using the expanding foam kits that are available, but then you're dedicated to using a trailer if you move it around and that sort of defeats the purpose of buying an Avon.  One of the biggest benefits to having an Avon is the ability to roll up the deflated boat into a cloth bag and stow the entire kit in a deck locker or a cabin cabinet.  If you've got tight space limitations, Avon inflatables are an IDEAL dinghy to have aboard.  They may not row the best, but they get top marks for stability and storage. History of this particular Avon Redcrest Dinghy.  Several years ago, a gracious individual bought a large sailboat for our Boy Scout Venture Crew here in Holland (Crew 2316) to use as a Sea Scout Ship.  While I mainly worked with the troop (T-316), the Scout Ship got underway (S-9136) and has been going for almost 10 years now.   That boat is an S2 Yacht named Encore (10-meter sailboat if I recall correctly?).  Last fall, I happened upon the estate sale of Mr. John Vanderveen here in Holland (also lived in Grand Rapids).  His family was liquidating the cottage on Lake Macatawa and he was the previous owner of Encore (wow, small world!).  Needless to say, we bought up a bunch of Encore memorabilia from when he raced it, including hats, life rings, and Chicago to Mackinac Race brochures with his personal notes, times, and race committee call locations (he raced IMS Section 7, see pics, he used to race along side DeVos in the older Windquest boat and Schostak in Fujimo).  All that stuff is going to stay with the ship and the adult leadership, but I was blessed to acquire the Avon Redcrest raft for my family.  Unfortunately, we haven't had time to patch it or use it yet as we're still busy working on our house and the essentials have to come first.  We've only taken the kids to the beach twice so far this year and it will be fall before we have more time for recreation like that. Note: This is a 9' raft.  I believe this model did not come with a roll-up wooden floor decking, that would have been for the next group of larger sizes and the storage bag doesn't seem large enough to handle the decking panels.  Again, I do not have oars for it, you would be providing your own.  Thanks for those who have inquired if it has or had a floor with it, this one does not but I don't doubt you could put the wood floor panels in if desired.  The yellow fiberglass section is the removable seat. Feel free to email or call at six, ohne, slx 499124nine.  We'd be happy to answer any questions that we can.
