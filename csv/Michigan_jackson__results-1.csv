Harris, is one of several premier boat manufactures out there, this is a quality built boat that has been take care of and maintained its entire life. There are no holes, rips or sun bleaching on any of the seats, or upholstery. The motor is oil injected, so there is no need to premix oil and gas. I was going to winterize it and sell it in the spring, but a friend suggested I try to sell it now, since the weather has been so nice. Everything works, all the lights, all the zippers on the bimini and on the mooring cover. (This has a custom made bimini cover that unzips in the middle. This is so the storage cover is easier to manage or if you only want to use half the boat in the evening, its a nice feature.) The lights work, the horn works, the radio did work in the summer, but seems to have a short that I can't find. I think its something simple because it will work now and then. The boat comes with everything you need, 10 life vests, anchor, dock bumpers, table, bimini top, mooring cover, rear entry attached ladder and a half a tank of already treated fuel. I'm asking $7800.00 not because I ""need"" to sell it, but because I thought I would see if I could. It's a very nice boat that has been professionally maintained at a local marina.
