Very attractive. Decals are in good condition. Rebuilt motor. I have the paperwork. Hull has about 150hours. Engine has less than 30. The good: Hull is great. This is one of the last light weight smaller hulls before we evolved to the 900lb giants produced today. Very few nicks or marks. No cracking in the fiberglass. Ski is very quick. Great on gas since it's fuel injected. All gauge functions work. Trim works. Security beeper works. Brand new starter. Was bad when I bought the ski in June, replaced it with brand new unit. The bad: Seat is faded and torn from age, but I have brand new fitted seat cover that hasn't been installed yet. There has been a reoccurring issue with the engine hesitation. Some weekends it goes fine. Other weekends it wants to limit itself to staying below ~2500rpms mid ride. My mechanic thinks it should be an easy fix, but since I have no long term intentions of keeping the ski, I'm putting it up for sale at a discounted value until I get time to take it to the dealer. In 100% running condition these will go for up to $2500. Given this particular skis engine issue, I am dropping price to $1400 OBO. Make me offers. Can help with delivery.

The boat was not used by us in 2016 whatsoever due to the restoration process. The restoration total does not include the price that I paid for the boat originally.

Included is a used Wesco 10,000 lb. GVW dual-axle bunk trailer with rear load guides and diamond plate fenders valued at $2,000.
