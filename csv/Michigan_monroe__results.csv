It does need a real good cleaning, if it didn't I would be asking for $4000 to $5000 for it.  Cabin is in pretty decent condition with no rips or tears in the fabric of the cabin. The carpet is complete just need to be cleaned.  It will need a new canvas top as the only one on it is ripped all to hell.  The outside seats will need to be cleaned real good and possibly redone. It has the OMC King Cobra outdrive which if you know anything about outdrives is pretty much bulletproof.  The engine is a 351 V-8 with 265 HP.  All fluids have been checked every year for the past 8 or years by Brest Bay Marina service department with no issues whatsoever.  No water in the outdrive oil.  Winterized every year.  The boat has been docked and stored at Brest Bay Marina for the past 8 years.  The engine, outdrive and trailer are worth more than $3250 by themselves. The boat comes with a dual axle trailer that came with the boat when I bought it 8+ years ago.  I'm not 100% sure of the condition of the trailer as it has been in storage at Brest Bay Marine for the 8 years I've had it docked and stored there.  It was in really good condition when I last used it way back when.  I will make sure that the trailer is in good working condition and is road worthy for the buyer upon pickup. A good scrubbing and this boat would look great.  I just don't have the time to do anything with it and the wife wants it gone!
