All new paint inside and outside the boat so it looks new.  Trailer has fresh paint, new lights and wiring.  Wheel bearing and seals were gone through and are good to go as are the tires.  The motor is a 1955 Johnson 5.5 HP.  It has been stored for 25 years inside a garage.  I replaced the water pump/impellor, rebuilt the carb with new jets, gaskets, and float.  This motor has also been converted to a modern fuel tank system with a brand new fuel pump so it does not have to use the two line, pump up, pressure tank that was original in those days.  The motor starts and runs great.  Don't be afraid of the age of this motor.  It has very few hours on it from the original owner who I bought it from.  He used it a couple years and then moved on to larger boats and motors which is why he put it in his garage for so long.  I was surprised to find how readily available parts are for these old motors in case you need anything. This would be a great starter boat for anyone who does not want to put a lot of money into something.  The only thing you may need would be a spare tire and rim since I don't have one for it and a small battery to run the depth finder.
