Until he got sick. 67 hours on engine meter since new... 24 foot house boat which is like a motor home on pontoons. ...he pulled the interior out to restore it and passed away before it was done. i have all of that in the garage ...sink oven fridge. ...all the cushions. .. way to much to list but if your interested its worth taking a look at. people have been asking width so its 8 foot 2 inches wide and 80 inches inside wall to wall. The trailer for this boat is worth almost what im asking for the boat itself.. its got 3 axles with brakes and 2 brand new tires we just bought so the buyer could get it home. I have a video of the engine running . Its a project but could be on the water as is with minor work. The title says CruiserCamper , hull type: Cabin. He purchased it in 1990. Clean title which in michigan is required for boats 20 ft or larger. Call me with any questions. Also it is all fiberglass with steel trailer. I found a book on houseboats he bought that has an interesting artical on this exact boat. Mabye a year or two different but definitely this boat and address of the manufacturer. Call or text only.
