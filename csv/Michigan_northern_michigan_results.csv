7,excellent,"['44.424243', '-83.343143']",2016-12-11 12:44,"Built in USA and has 5.7 in-board Volvo Engine. This is last year of production for Chris-Craft deck boat series. Versatile boat ideal for all types of lakes and open water because it can handle the big water and yet runs in just 3-4 foot of draft -- a must have for shallow lakes. I have taken it out with ease on Lake Huron as well as several inland lakes and dams. Has a head, pressure water/flush system, outside shower, the bow makes into a bed-see pics, and clear vinyl/screen enclosures have never been used. Atlantis carpeting looks new and the boat has an extended swim platform at the stern. I have owned this boat for ten years and during that time all service has been performed by a Certified Volvo Mechanic at the marina. I have the marina winterize and store it inside every winter. The boat is cleaned and waxed often. The upholstery is conditioned almost every time we take it out, notice there is no mold or discoloring on the seats. This boat has been in fresh water only and has very low hours -- average 10 hours per season. The Magic Tilt aluminum (no rust) trailer is also included in this sale. Trailer is serviced regularly. We upgraded the trailer by replacing the bunks with ""Long Run Self Centering Bunk Glide Ons"" installed by the Marina and guide posts too. This makes loading and unloading fast and easy. This boat was $66,000 new and the trailer was $7,500. We have had the Marina install extras that are included in this sale such as: Ship to Shore radio $525 3500 Lowrance GPS/Digital Sonar & Fish Finder $2,199 Hydraulic steering actuator $806 Trim limiters - $314 Boat trailer -- lengthened and replaced bunks, upgraded trailer jack, spare tire mount, permalock bunk brackets comes to about $2,300 in trailer upgrades. Also included are: Bimini top Bow cover Cockpit cover Screen/clear vinyl weather enclosure for cockpit Cushions to turn bow into a bed Full boat cover, custom bow to stern, down to hull cover in Top Gun Marine fabric $980 Matching trailer tire covers $90 12+ orange life vests Check out the photos -- this boat is in excellent condition and would be ideal for collectors.",320,5914954909,44.424243,26,-83.343143,Chris Craft,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@44.424243,-83.343143,16z",262 Sport Deck,$34900,power,,26' Chris Craft 262 Deck Boat & Trailer,https://nmi.craigslist.org/boa/5914954909.html,2001

Superior (circumnavigated 2013) by the present owners for the past 38 years.  Lovingly maintained over this time, she is a well equipped, capable cruiser in turn key condition.  With roller furling jib and all control lines led to the cockpit, she is easily handled with crew protected by a custom rigid dodger.  Below deck, the cabin is surprisingly spacious with almost 6' headroom, comfortable for cruising weeks at a time.  The enclosed head, hanging locker, and private forward V-berth give the feel of a much larger boat while the 2 quarter berths and folding dinette table provide room for family or guests. Well maintained Volvo Penta MD1, 1 cyl, 7 hp inboard diesel engine; cockpit mounted oil, temp, and voltage gauges.  25 gal fresh water, 27 gal holding, and 10 gal fuel tanks lengthen cruise capabilities.  Stainless steel pulpit and stern pushpit, double lifelines with gates, and stern mounted boarding ladder make for safe sailing.  Full battened main, roller furling genoa, 2 smaller jibs, asymmetric spinnaker with sock, and riding sail are all in sail ready condition.  The new Lewmar ST 30 chrome winches make handling the jibs very easy while the adjustable lazy jacks allow easy control of the furled main.  The electrical wiring has been extensively upgraded, as has the starter/charging system, two deep-cycle marine batteries, and navigation lights.  Regency VHF, Garmin 521S GPS/Chart plotter/ depth sounder, and Raymarine ST2000+ tiller pilot get you where you want to go while the two Danforth anchors, long chain and nylon rides make for safe anchorages once you get there.
