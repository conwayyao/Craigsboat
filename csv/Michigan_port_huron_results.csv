Known issues with engine ~25 years ago included Selectric Shift not engaging with every button push, hesitation on acceleration under load. There is no trailer included. You would need to either tow it or bring your own battery and premix (or use a kicker motor) to get it to the nearest ramp, approximately 2 miles via canal or similar distance across the bay.
