Four Winns started with its patented Stable-Vee design and created a new generation specifically for the SL. It's called Stable-Vee SC for ""split chine."" In this design, a single chine aft splits into two chines as it progresses forward. The outer chine remains far outward while the inner chine curves sharply inward creating a finer entry. The result is a boat that provides excellent lateral stability for which Stable-Vee is renowned, a superior ride, gets up on plane quickly, with minimal bow rise and excellent cornering. The bow is uniquely elongated, providing a convenient skid-resistant platform for boarding the boat or securing the anchor. An anchor locker with hidden telescoping ladder provides the perfect space for storage when the anchor is not in use. Once aboard, the bow also boasts a spacious seating area with a clever backrest to create a fully enclosed sun lounge roomy enough for three. Cockpit seating includes two super-wide Comfort-Ride Plus seats that feature flip-up bolsters, and stainless steel assist rails. Just behind the captain, a water sports observer?s seat is logically placed and conceals an under-seat cooler for easy access to beverages and snacks. A nearby sidewall sink is available as an option. The L-shaped lounge and stern seating is reminiscent of a living room sofa with comfort, style and functionality. The base of the seat pulls out to create an even more inviting lounge space. Of course, seats feature top-quality marine-grade upholstery, in a variety of color schemes that compliment the boat?s exterior colors. The cockpit includes snap-in carpet over a fiberglass liner.

Yamaha's renowned internal propulsion system is not only reliable and fuel-efficient, it also offers the highest level of freedom achievable on the water. The concept is simple: Water is pulled through internally housed propellers and pushed out through marine engines with high thrust points. This technology eliminates the need for an exposed drivetrain, allowing Yamaha boats to plane quicker with less bow rise. The minimal draft makes navigating shallow areas easy. But the benefits don’t end there - internal propulsion eliminates the need for a bulky engine hatch, opening up an expansive swim platform where family and friends can relax close to the water.
