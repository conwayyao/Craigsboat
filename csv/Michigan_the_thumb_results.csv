Water System - I have not used the water system extensively.Â  There is a head separate from the shower.Â  Shower bilge needs replacement.Â  It has a hot water heater that I used once years ago but then had winterized and have not used since.Â  It worked great at last use.Â  I replaced the main water pump about 6 years ago but relied primarily on city water for pressurized water. There is a steering console in the cabin and bridge.Â  AM/FM Radio installed also can be controlled from both stations.Â  Marine radio and spotlight controls at both stations.Â  Loudspeaker system at upper deck. I replaced most of the carpet with Colombia Wood Laminate flooring.Â Galley has a range with oven.Â  Nolcor fridge is full height and has a separate freezer - new installed in 2011.Â  Sink has two sides.Â The salon has a pull out sofa and rocker chair.Â  There is a center table across from the galley that drops to a bed with storage underneath.Â  There is a spacious hanging locker accessible from the front stateroom or main salon.Â  The front stateroom sleeps 2 and is separated by its own door with a separate hatch for ventilation. For canvases, I have the canvas for the front window and to cover the top.Â  Both are worn but usable, with the upper cover having a tear in one spot.Â  I no longer have the bimini cover as winds in Bay City tore it, however I do have the bimini frame. Battery charger was new in 2010. I have wheeled and waxed the hull every year.Â  Above the rub line recently powerwashed completely.Â  Bottom is due for new paint as this year is the third year for the antifouling three year paint.  Currently in process of restoring the wood rails and swim platform. If you have any questions, please let me know.Â  I have had a lot of fun on this boat and many memories.Â  Hoping to find someone who will continue the same.",950,5894368142,,33,,Carver,,Voyager 33,$7500,power, (Bay Port),1979 Carver Voyager *** PRICE DROP BEFORE WINTER ***,https://thumb.craigslist.org/boa/5894368142.html,

I have only used the boat about twice a year, primarily for camping trips up to northern Ontario. The boat has never leaked, and it's been a very reliable boat. I have taken it a couple times to a lake that is 30 miles long with no houses or cabins anywhere on the lake. In other words, I trust this boat on big lakes with nobody around for help. It's a tough little boat. The trailer is old, but it too has been reliable. One of the lakes we go to is 9 hours away, and I have had no problems with the trailer at all. I have installed new wiring & lights on it. I also have 2 brand new wheels for it, which cost me $100 (not shown). The only reason I am selling it is because my kids are growing and we needed just a bit larger boat to carry our gear.",,5852851467,43.026377,12,-83.087862,,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@43.026377,-83.087862,16z",,$450,power, (Imlay City),12' Mirrocraft boat with trailer,https://thumb.craigslist.org/boa/5852851467.html,
