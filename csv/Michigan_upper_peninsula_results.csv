These are hard to find and regarded as one of the best aluminum fish & ski combo boats you can get. Very functional layout for fishing or having fun with the family. The bow converts from a fishing platform to seating in a matter of seconds. I'll include the extended length seat post, and you can use one of the other seats if you want to fish from the front. There is a hookup for a trolling motor up front as well (there is room for a couple more batteries in the rear if you want to run a 24v trolling motor). There are two storage compartments, along with a 20 gallon aerated livewell. There are currently 4 seats in the boat. Two are original, and two are aftermarket. They are showing their age, but functional. There is a radio with CD and MP3 input, Garmin 400C color fishfinder, Garmin GPSmap 492, side storage with rod holders on one side, full walk through windshield, and storage under each side of the console. All the gauges work, and I just replaced the tach with a new Faria. There is a 31 gallon fuel tank. The livewell pump and bilge pumps both work. The rear platform is pretty roomy and great to fish off of. There are two seat bases if you wanted to move seats up there to fish. There is another 15 gallon aerated livewell, large enclosed storage area with the battery (and room for more - see above), and a side storage that is also fairly roomy. I converted the navigation and anchor lights to LED to save the battery for night fishing. The gauges are backlit, and there is a courtesy light as well. There is a bimini top that was new last year, along with it's cover. There is also a boat cover I'll include. The trailer is a Karavan bunk and it's in very good condition. I recently replaced the bearings & bearing covers, winch, and roller jack, and new wiring and lights were added in the last couple years. It also has new wheels and tires with one trip to Twin Lakes and few local trips so I'd guess at most they have 100 miles on them. The motor is a Mercury 125hp 2-stroke that had the powerhead replaced last summer by a certified Mercury mechanic and it has at most 40 hours on it since the rebuild. The motor runs great, has power tilt & trim, and I'll included a new impeller kit with it that I had bought as a spare. The lower unit oil was replaced last fall. Has a 19p prop that is like new, and a 21 pitch that is a little beat up but functional. *Here's the deal, I absolutely love this boat, but I really want a 4 stroke motor, and given the age/value of the boat I'm having a hard time justifying spending as much as the boat value on a new motor. That being said, I'm also listing this motor for sale, so if for some reason I sell the motor then I'll be repowering and keeping the boat. Being realistic, however, I fully understand that my chances of selling the motor alone are slim. Also, the Honda 15hp kicker shown in the pictures isn't included in the sale, but if you're interested in the boat we might be able to work out a deal we're both happy with to include it.",40,5839312997,,17,,Crestliner,,Sportfish 1750,$11500,power, (Houghton),2002 Crestliner 1750 w/Mercury 125,https://up.craigslist.org/boa/5839312997.html,2002

I've had it on small lakes, rivers and the bay. It has plenty of storage for a 16.5 foot boat. Has a large live well as well as a bait well too. Starts immediately, always. No dents or leaks. Completely dry when you pull the drain plug after fishing. Trailer is a yaht club with the foldable tongue for more room when storing. Bearing buddies, spare tire, and upgraded fender walls also. And a spare tire. Flaws: -could use new carpet within the next couple years if you're picky. -gas and speedometer gauge don't work(bad ground I believe). Although the graph speedometer works great and if you run out of gas with the 4 stroke there's something wrong. Asking $8000. In storage now. Price is going back up in the spring.
