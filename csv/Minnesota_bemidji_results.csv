This boat will look like new when it's on the water; but it costs less than new ones like this cost nowadays. We put all New Pontoon Furniture on this boat, including a New Steering Consul, New Captain's Chair, New L-shaped Sofa in the back and 2 New Swiveling Fish Seats up front so it can seat from 5 to 8 people depending on their age, size and weight. We put a New Deck with 3/4 inch Marine Grade Plywood and New Heavy Duty Marine Vinyl on it. The Vinyl Flooring dries much quicker than carpet does, is a lot easier to clean and maintain than carpet, and doesn't get moldy like carpet so easily does. We also put a Brand New Heavy Duty Bimini Top on that provides shade for most of the boat. The railing are in very good condition. Both pontoons are in excellent condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. It has an excellent 2004 15 HP MERCURY 4-Stroke Motor with Power Trim and Tilt. This pontoon boat was on a lake and in use last summer. It was driven onto this trailer this fall when I got it on a trade in on a bigger pontoon boat. We have started it up since we refurbished the boat and it started right up and ran real well. It runs very quiet and smooth and clean, and it will always get great gas mileage! We could start it up for you; but it has been winterized. It includes a new battery and new gas tank so it's all ready to use in the spring. It comes with a hard to find Aluminum Bunk Style Pontoon Trailer that is in excellent condition. This light weight pontoon boat and trailer can easily be towed with a 4 or 6 cylinder car, small truck or any size SUV. We put 2 New Tires on the trailer and kept a used one for a spare. This little pontoon boat is ideal for all of the smaller lakes and rivers in the upper mid-west and the trailer is ideal for people who have to frequently trailer their boat because they do not own lake shore property or have a boat lift or slip. All the lights on the boat and trailer work. This boat is currently registered until 2019 and the trailer has a lifetime registration sticker on it. Please Note: If you buy it now, I can store it in my shop for the winter or have it shrink wrapped and deliver it anywhere in Minnesota for free. You can look at it anytime, even in the evenings or on weekends, if I know when to meet you. I sold all my refurbished pontoon boats this year; except for the ones we refinished in November and December which are currently posted on Craigslist. I do have 3 other small pontoon boats available. You can check them out by entering: ""Pontoon Boat Remer"" or ""Refurbished Pontoon Boat"" in Minneapolis Craigslist or by simply clicking on the link: ""more ads by this user"" on the right side of this posting. I delete all my CL ads whenever I sell any boats, so if they are still posted, then they are still available.

It even comes with a heavy duty Bunk Pontoon Trailer that was originally made for this pontoon boat. This pontoon boat was completely refurbished a year and a half ago. It had a new marine grade plywood deck put on it with new carpet at that time along with a new steering consul and all new high quality furniture with a lot of cup holders. The boat lights and stereo were completely rewired and it had a new Stereo installed in it. It has a comfortable L-shaped Sofa in the back with a Recliner on one side, a very good Captain's Chair and 2 good Swiveling Fish Seats up front. All of the furniture is in excellent condition without any cuts, tears, holes, cracks or fading. It can comfortably seat 7 to 9 people depending on their age, size and weight. There is storage space inside all the bench seats. It has a good live well in the middle. I ordered a new heavy duty Bimini Top for it that is not pictured in these photos because it was back ordered. The railing is in good condition. It has the lower fishing railing which makes it easier to lift fish over the railing or to lean over it to net any big fish. This boat was originally manufactured in 1987 as was the trailer. The pontoons are still in very good condition. We pressure tested both of them and they do not have any leaks. It was in use all summer long and was driven onto the bunk trailer it is pictured on this fall. It comes with a used 2000 Oil Injected YAMAHA 90 HP 2-Stroke Motor that is in excellent condition. It has power trim and tilt and a long shaft, which is ideal for pontoon boats. I was told by the previous owner that it can easily pull kids of any age and weight on tubes and can even pull water skiers! I put it in a local lake in late October and it started right up and ran great. We could start it up for you; but it's been winterized. It has been set up with 2 gas tanks with a fuel line for each one and includes a battery so it will be all ready to use in the spring. It has a clear title without any liens on it.

I can have it shrink wrapped and/or store it for the winter or deliver it anywhere within 300 miles for free if you buy it this winter. If you are looking at pontoon boats at this time of the year, you must know this is the best time of the year to buy one; but the worst time of the year to sell them.

This boat is ideal for all the smaller lakes and rivers in the upper mid-west. It can easily be towed with a 4 or 6 cylinder car, small truck or SUV. This boat is in excellent condition because it was always stored inside a shed year around whenever it wasn't in use. And it never was used very much because it was owned by a hard working family farmer who did not own any lake property so he had to trailer it whenever he had time to use it, which he said wasn't very often. There is a nice bench seat in the back and 2 good swiveling fish seats in front so it seats 4 or 5 people. It includes a nearly new fish locator/depth finder. It has a live well that works well. There is a radio with an antenna. It includes a portable swim ladder that can be attached on the front deck as well as one side. It has two side gates and a gate in the front. The railing is in very good condition. It has the lower fishing rails around the front half, which make it easier to lift fish into the boat or net bigger fish. It has a very solid marine grade deck with carpet that's in excellent condition. The deck is 6' wide by 14' long; but the pontoons are actually 16 feet long so it is titled as a 16 foot boat. It has a good bimini top. Both pontoons are in excellent condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. It has a good used 1999 25 HP EVINRUDE 2-Stroke Motor with power trim and tilt. The motor has a long shaft, which is ideal for pontoon boats. I've had the motor checked out, tuned up and started up by a marine mechanic since we refurbished this boat. It started right up and ran real good! We could start it up for you; but it has been winterized. It includes a battery and an extra large 12 gallon gas tank so it's all ready to use in the spring.

63,excellent,[],2016-11-28 23:44,"I have lowered the price $500 on this nicely refurbished small 16' KENNEDY Fish and Cruise Pontoon Boat with a 15 HP YAMAHA 4-STROKE Motor with Power Trim and Tilt in outstanding condition that comes with an excellent Roll On Trailer. This boat has a comfortable new L-shaped Sofa in the back and 2 new swiveling Fish Seats in front so it seats 5 to 7 people depending on their age and size. It has a new deck made with 3/4"" marine grade plywood with new marine Vinyl Flooring, which dries much quicker than carpet, is a lot easier to clean and maintain than carpet, and doesn't get moldy like carpet often does. The deck is only 6 feet wide by 14 feet long; but the pontoons are 16 feet long so it is actually registered as a 16 foot boat. It comes with a hard to find, exceptionally good, Roll On Pontoon Trailer with good rollers on the bottom as well as on both sides which was manufactured specifically for this boat. This is not a bunk or scissors trailer like almost all other pontoon trailers. However, it is one of the easiest pontoon trailers to load and unload ever made, and it can easily be towed with a 4 or 6 cylinder car, small truck or SUV. We put 2 new tires and a new crank up winch on the trailer. This boat is ideal for all of the smaller lakes and rivers in the upper mid-west and this trailer is ideal for people who frequently have to trailer their boat because they do not have a slip or own lake shore property. The railing are in good condition; although the decals are somewhat weathered. It has a good bimini top. Both of the pontoons are in excellent condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. It has an excellent 2005 15 HP YAMAHA 4-Stroke Motor with Power Trim and Tilt. This boat was on a lake and in use this summer, and was driven onto the trailer when I bought it this fall. We have started it up since we refurbished this boat and it starts right up and runs really well! I was told by the previous owner that this motor has very low hours on it. I can't verify that, although the motor sure looks like it hasn't been used much. It runs very smooth and clean and quiet, and it will always get great gas mileage! The motor has a long shaft, which is ideal for pontoon boats. We could start it up for you; but it has been winterized. It includes a battery and a gas tank so it's all ready to use in the spring. All of the lights on the boat and trailer work. The boat is currently registered until 2019 and the trailer has a lifetime registration. Please Note: I have had it shrink wrapped since these photos were taken; but I can cut an opening so you can see inside it. If you buy it now, I can store it for the winter or deliver it anywhere in Minnesota for free. If you are looking at pontoon boats at this time of the year, you must know this is the best time of the year to buy one; but the worst time of the year to sell them. That's why you can save $1000 from what I can sell this boat, motor and trailer for in the springtime if you buy it now. You can look at it anytime, even in the evenings or on the weekends, if I know when to meet you. I sold almost all of my refurbished pontoon boats this year; except for several we finished in Nov. that are currently posted on Craigslist. I have 3 more that are real close to being restored which I will post on CL as soon as they are done. You can check them out by entering: ""Pontoon Boat Remer"" or ""Refurbished Pontoon Boat"" in any Minnesota Craigslist or by simply clicking on the link: ""more ads by this user"" on the right side of this posting. I delete all of my boat ads whenever I sell one, so if they are posted, then they are available. This boat is located 60 miles from Bemidji and Brainerd, 30 miles from Walker and Grand Rapids, 180 miles from Grand Forks, 140 miles east of Fargo, 100 miles west of Duluth, 120 miles south of the Canadian border and 160 miles north of the Twin Cities.
