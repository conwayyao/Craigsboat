Today Island Falls Canoe produces a number of E.M.

It has a slight arch across the bottom, rocker, narrow entries and a classic sheerline that looks great and keeps the rough water out. A model of proven superiority by generations of foresters, wardens, campers, and guides. It is in excellent, lightly used condition, always stored indoors.

56,like new,[],2016-12-15 18:49,"Newly Refurbished 2005 20' WEERES Pontoon Boat with JOHNSON 50 HP 4-STROKE EFI Motor that is in Excellent Condition. It will look like new when it's on the water; but costs a lot less than new ones like this cost nowadays! We put all New Pontoon Furniture on it, including a New Steering Consul, New Captain's Chair, New L-shaped Sofa in the back, 2 New Bench Seats up front and 2 New Swivel Fish Seats on the front deck. It can comfortably seat 10-12 People; but officially has a US Coast Guard Maximum Seating Capacity of 14 Persons or 2480 lbs. It has a good solid deck made with 3/4 inch Marine Grade Plywood with New Heavy Duty Marine Vinyl on it. The Vinyl Flooring dries much quicker than carpet does, is a lot easier to clean and maintain than carpet, and doesn't get moldy like carpet so easily does. We also put a Brand New Heavy Duty Bimini Top on it. It includes a little round table by the L-shaped Sofa. I have a new Depth Finder/Fish Locator for it I had not installed when I took these photos; but I plan on having it installed soon. The railing are in excellent condition. It has 4 entry gates, including a rear entry with a strong and sturdy built on swim ladder. This boat has the large diameter pontoons so it can carry more people, planes out quicker, floats higher and so water won't come over the deck, even on windy days. Both pontoons are in very good condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. This pontoon boat was on a lake and in use all last summer and fall. It was driven across a lake and onto a trailer late this fall. It has a 2004 50 HP JOHNSON 4-Stroke Motor with Electronic Fuel Injection and Power Trim and Tilt on it which has been on this boat since it was manufactured that is in excellent condition. I've had it checked out, cleaned up and tuned up by a very good marine mechanic since we refurbished it and it started right up and ran really well. It runs very smooth and clean and quiet, and it won't burn too much gas! We could start it up for you; but it was winterized. It comes with a new extra large 12 gallon gas tank and a new battery so it's all ready to use in the spring. The title is clear without any liens on it. Please Note: You can buy this pontoon boat and motor for $12,000 without a trailer or for $13,500 with a new dual axle bunk pontoon trailer. If you buy it now, I can store it for the winter in my shop or deliver it anywhere in Minnesota for free. It is located in my shop in the small town of Remer in north central Minnesota, which is 100 miles west of Duluth, 30 miles from Grand Rapids and Walker, 60 miles from Brainerd and Bemidji, 120 miles from St Cloud, 140 miles east of Fargo, 120 miles south of the Canadian border, 160 miles from Minneapolis and 270 miles north of the Iowa border. You can look at it anytime, even in the evenings or on weekends, if I know when to meet you there. Thank you for considering my pontoon boats and I hope to talk with you sometime soon. Call or Text JIM ANYTIME (including evenings and weekends) on my cell phone at: 218-256-9543 if you have any questions or concerns whatsoever or if you want to see or buy a nicely refurbished pontoon boat. I sold all of the pontoon boats we refurbished this year, except the 8 we refinished in November and December, which are currently posted on Minneapolis Craigslist. You can check them out by entering: ""Pontoon Boat Remer"" or ""Refurbished Pontoon Boat"" in Minneapolis Craigslist or by simply clicking on the link ""more ads by this user"" on the right side of this posting. I delete all my boat ads whenever I sell one, so if they are still posted on Craigslist, then they are still available. I take some used pontoon boats and pontoon trailers on trade ins; but I'm pretty particular about the condition of the pontoons and especially the motors, and I really do prefer pontoon boats with 4-stroke motors on them.

66,excellent,[],2016-12-15 05:42,"Nice Little 16' PALM BEACH Fish and Cruise Pontoon Boat with a 25 HP EVINRUDE Motor and a good Spartan Bunk Style Pontoon Trailer. This boat is ideal for all the smaller lakes and rivers in the upper mid-west. It can easily be towed with a 4 or 6 cylinder car, small truck or SUV. This boat is in excellent condition because it was always stored inside a shed year around whenever it wasn't in use. And it never was used very much because it was owned by a hard working family farmer who did not own any lake property so he had to trailer it whenever he had time to use it, which he said wasn't very often. There is a nice bench seat in the back and 2 good swiveling fish seats in front so it seats 4 or 5 people. It includes a nearly new fish locator/depth finder. It has a live well that works well. There is a radio with an antenna. It includes a portable swim ladder that can be attached on the front deck as well as one side. It has two side gates and a gate in the front. The railing is in very good condition. It has the lower fishing rails around the front half, which make it easier to lift fish into the boat or net bigger fish. It has a very solid marine grade deck with carpet that's in excellent condition. The deck is 6' wide by 14' long; but the pontoons are actually 16 feet long so it is titled as a 16 foot boat. It has a good bimini top. Both pontoons are in excellent condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. It has a good used 1999 25 HP EVINRUDE 2-Stroke Motor with power trim and tilt. The motor has a long shaft, which is ideal for pontoon boats. I've had the motor checked out, tuned up and started up by a marine mechanic since we refurbished this boat. It started right up and ran real good! We could start it up for you; but it has been winterized. It includes a battery and an extra large 12 gallon gas tank so it's all ready to use in the spring. I paid $150 for 2 brand new tires we put on this trailer, and it has a used spare tire as well. I have 3 other small refurbished pontoon boats currently available as well as several bigger ones. You can check them out by entering: ""Pontoon Boat Remer MN"" or ""Refurbished Pontoon Boat"" in Minneapolis Craigslist or by clicking the link: ""more ads by this user"" on the right side of this posting. Please Note: I had it shrink wrapped since these photos were taken; but I can cut a slit so you can look inside it. If you buy it now, I'll even store it for the winter or deliver it anywhere in Minnesota for free. If you are looking at pontoon boats at this time of the year, you must know this is the best time of the year to buy one; but the worst time of the year to sell them. That's why you can save $1000 from what I can sell this boat, motor and trailer for in the springtime. You can look at it anytime, even in the evenings or on the weekends, if I know when to meet you. It is located behind my shop in the small town of Remer in north central Minnesota, which is 100 miles west of Duluth/Superior, 30 miles from Grand Rapids and Walker, 60 miles from Brainerd and Bemidji, 120 miles from St Cloud, 160 miles north of Minneapolis, 140 miles east of Fargo and 120 miles south of the Canadian border. Thank you for considering my pontoon boats and I hope to talk with you sometime soon.

This boat will look like new when it's on the water; but it costs less than new ones like this cost nowadays. We put all New Pontoon Furniture on this boat, including a New Steering Consul, New Captain's Chair, New L-shaped Sofa in the back and 2 New Swiveling Fish Seats up front so it can seat from 5 to 8 people depending on their age, size and weight. We put a New Deck with 3/4 inch Marine Grade Plywood and New Heavy Duty Marine Vinyl on it. The Vinyl Flooring dries much quicker than carpet does, is a lot easier to clean and maintain than carpet, and doesn't get moldy like carpet so easily does. We also put a Brand New Heavy Duty Bimini Top on that provides shade for most of the boat. The railing are in very good condition. Both pontoons are in excellent condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. It has an excellent 2004 15 HP MERCURY 4-Stroke Motor with Power Trim and Tilt. This pontoon boat was on a lake and in use last summer. It was driven onto this trailer this fall when I got it on a trade in on a bigger pontoon boat. We have started it up since we refurbished the boat and it started right up and ran real well. It runs very quiet and smooth and clean, and it will always get great gas mileage! We could start it up for you; but it has been winterized. It includes a new battery and new gas tank so it's all ready to use in the spring. It comes with a hard to find Aluminum Bunk Style Pontoon Trailer that is in excellent condition. This light weight pontoon boat and trailer can easily be towed with a 4 or 6 cylinder car, small truck or any size SUV. We put 2 New Tires on the trailer and kept a used one for a spare. This little pontoon boat is ideal for all of the smaller lakes and rivers in the upper mid-west and the trailer is ideal for people who have to frequently trailer their boat because they do not own lake shore property or have a boat lift or slip. All the lights on the boat and trailer work. This boat is currently registered until 2019 and the trailer has a lifetime registration sticker on it. Please Note: If you buy it now, I can store it in my shop for the winter or have it shrink wrapped and deliver it anywhere in Minnesota for free. You can look at it anytime, even in the evenings or on weekends, if I know when to meet you. I sold all my refurbished pontoon boats this year; except for the ones we refinished in November and December which are currently posted on Craigslist. I do have 3 other small pontoon boats available. You can check them out by entering: ""Pontoon Boat Remer"" or ""Refurbished Pontoon Boat"" in Minneapolis Craigslist or by simply clicking on the link: ""more ads by this user"" on the right side of this posting. I delete all my CL ads whenever I sell any boats, so if they are still posted, then they are still available.
