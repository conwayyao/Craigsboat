It will look like new when it's on the water; but costs a lot less than new ones like this cost nowadays! We put all New Pontoon Furniture on it, including a New Steering Consul, New Captain's Chair, New L-shaped Sofa in the back, 2 New Bench Seats up front and 2 New Swivel Fish Seats on the front deck. It can comfortably seat 10-12 People; but officially has a US Coast Guard Maximum Seating Capacity of 14 Persons. It has a good solid deck made with 3/4 inch Marine Grade Plywood with New Heavy Duty Marine Vinyl. The Vinyl Flooring dries much quicker than carpet does, is a lot easier to clean and maintain than carpet, and doesn't get moldy like carpet so easily does. We also put a Brand New Heavy Duty Bimini Top on it. There is a little round table by the L-shaped Sofa (not shown in all of the photos.) It has a new Depth Finder/Fish Locator that had not been installed when I took these photos. The railing are in excellent condition. It has 4 entry gates, including a rear entry with a strong and sturdy built on swim ladder. This boat has the large diameter pontoons that can carry more people, plane out quicker and float higher so water won't come over the deck, even on windy days. Both pontoons are in very good condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. This pontoon boat was on a lake and in use all last summer and fall. It was driven across a lake and onto a trailer late this fall. It has a 2004 50 HP JOHNSON 4-Stroke Motor with Electronic Fuel Injection and Power Trim and Tilt that is in excellent condition. I had it checked out, cleaned up and tuned up by a very good marine mechanic since we refurbished it and he said it started right up and ran really well. It runs very smooth and clean and quiet, and it won't burn too much gas! We could start it up for you; but it was winterized. It comes with a new extra large 12 gallon gas tank and a new battery so it's all ready to use in the spring. The title is clear without any liens on it. Please Note: You can buy this pontoon boat and motor for $12,000 without a trailer or for $13,500 with a new dual axle bunk pontoon trailer. If you buy it now, I can store it for the winter in my shop or deliver it anywhere in Minnesota for free. It is located in my shop in the small town of Remer in north central Minnesota, which is 250 miles from Rochester, 160 miles north of Minneapolis, 100 miles west of Duluth, 60 miles from Brainerd and Bemidji, 120 miles from St Cloud, 140 miles east of Fargo, 120 miles south of the Canadian border and 270 miles north of the Iowa border.

This boat has a comfortable new L-shaped Sofa in the back and 2 new swiveling Fish Seats in front so it seats 5 to 7 people depending on their age and size. It has a new deck made with 3/4"" marine grade plywood with new marine Vinyl Flooring, which dries much quicker than carpet, is a lot easier to clean and maintain than carpet, and doesn't get moldy like carpet often does. The deck is only 6 feet wide by 14 feet long; but the pontoons are 16 feet long so it is actually registered as a 16 foot boat. It comes with a hard to find, exceptionally good, Roll On Pontoon Trailer with good rollers on the bottom as well as on both sides which was manufactured specifically for this boat. This is not a bunk or scissors trailer like almost all other pontoon trailers. However, it is one of the easiest pontoon trailers to load and unload ever made, and it can easily be towed with a 4 or 6 cylinder car, small truck or SUV. We put 2 new tires and a new crank up winch on the trailer. This boat is ideal for all of the smaller lakes and rivers in the upper mid-west and this trailer is ideal for people who frequently have to trailer their boat because they do not have a slip or own lake shore property. The railing are in good condition; although the decals are somewhat weathered. It has a good bimini top. Both of the pontoons are in excellent condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. It has an excellent 2005 15 HP YAMAHA 4-Stroke Motor with Power Trim and Tilt. This boat was on a lake and in use this summer, and was driven onto the trailer when I bought it this fall. We have started it up since we refurbished this boat and it starts right up and runs really well! I was told by the previous owner that this motor has very low hours on it. I can't verify that, although the motor sure looks like it hasn't been used much. It runs very smooth and clean and quiet, and it will always get great gas mileage! The motor has a long shaft, which is ideal for pontoon boats. We could start it up for you; but it has been winterized. It includes a battery and a gas tank so it's all ready to use in the spring. All of the lights on the boat and trailer work. The boat is currently registered until 2019 and the trailer has a lifetime registration. Please Note: I have had it shrink wrapped since these photos were taken; but I can cut an opening so you can see inside it. If you buy it now, I can store it for the winter or deliver it anywhere in Minnesota for free. If you are looking at pontoon boats at this time of the year, you must know this is the best time of the year to buy one; but the worst time of the year to sell them. That's why you can save $1000 from what I can sell this boat, motor and trailer for in the springtime if you buy it now. You can look at it anytime, even in the evenings or on the weekends, if I know when to meet you. I sold almost all of my refurbished pontoon boats this year; except for several we finished in Nov. that are currently posted on Craigslist. I have 3 more that are real close to being restored which I will post on CL as soon as they are done. You can check them out by entering: ""Pontoon Boat Remer"" or ""Refurbished Pontoon Boat"" in any Minnesota Craigslist or by simply clicking on the link: ""more ads by this user"" on the right side of this posting.

58,excellent,[],2016-11-30 21:16,"Nice Little 16' PALM BEACH Fish and Cruise Pontoon Boat with a 25 HP EVINRUDE Motor and a good Spartan Bunk Style Pontoon Trailer. This boat is ideal for all the smaller lakes and rivers in the upper mid-west. It can easily be towed with a 4 or 6 cylinder car, small truck or SUV. This boat is in excellent condition because it was always stored inside a shed year around whenever it wasn't in use. And it never was used very much because it was owned by a hard working family farmer who did not own any lake property so he had to trailer it whenever he had time to use it, which he said wasn't very often. There is a nice bench seat in the back and 2 good swiveling fish seats in front so it seats 4 or 5 people. It includes a nearly new fish locator/depth finder. It has a live well that works well. There is a radio with an antenna. It includes a portable swim ladder that can be attached on the front deck as well as one side. It has two side gates and a gate in the front. The railing is in very good condition. It has the lower fishing rails around the front half, which make it easier to lift fish into the boat or net bigger fish. It has a very solid marine grade deck with carpet that's in excellent condition. The deck is 6' wide by 14' long; but the pontoons are actually 16 feet long so it is titled as a 16 foot boat. It has a good bimini top. Both pontoons are in excellent condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. It has a good used 1999 25 HP EVINRUDE 2-Stroke Motor with power trim and tilt. The motor has a long shaft, which is ideal for pontoon boats. I've had the motor checked out, tuned up and started up by a marine mechanic since we refurbished this boat. It started right up and ran real good! We could start it up for you; but it has been winterized. It includes a battery and an extra large 12 gallon gas tank so it's all ready to use in the spring. I paid $150 for 2 brand new tires we put on this trailer, and it has a used spare tire as well. I have 3 other small refurbished pontoon boats currently available as well as several bigger ones. You can check them out by entering: ""Pontoon Boat Remer MN"" or ""Refurbished Pontoon Boat"" in Minneapolis Craigslist or by clicking the link: ""more ads by this user"" on the right side of this posting. Please Note: I had it shrink wrapped since these photos were taken; but I can cut a slit so you can look inside it. If you buy it now, I'll even store it for the winter or deliver it anywhere in Minnesota for free. If you are looking at pontoon boats at this time of the year, you must know this is the best time of the year to buy one; but the worst time of the year to sell them. That's why you can save $1000 from what I can sell this boat, motor and trailer for in the springtime. You can look at it anytime, even in the evenings or on the weekends, if I know when to meet you. It is behind my shop in the small town of Remer in north central Minnesota, which is located 250 miles from Rochester, 160 miles north of the Twin Cities, 30 miles from Grand Rapids and Walker, 60 miles from Brainerd and Bemidji, 100 miles west of Duluth, 120 miles south of the Canadian border, 140 miles east of Fargo and 270 miles north of the Iowa border.

I have a 6 HP Mercury 60 on the back and it works great. I have a front bow mount troller that's a minnkota and is a 27lb thrust. Foot pedal works as it should n I have no issues w either troller or engine. Great package. I will include is a lowrance fish finder. Had it on my other boat and never installed it on this boat but comes with it you'd just need to install the sonar thing. I have two regular lifejackets I'll throw in with it. The trailer is a tilt trailer. Lights work but the wiring looks like it could use new wiring. Still works now though. Great deal before winter flip it in the spring for more $.

82,excellent,[],2016-11-28 21:59,"You can easily pull 2 or even 3 Tubers at the same time with this recently refurbished 18' LOWE Fish and Cruise Style Pontoon Boat with a good 2000 Oil Injected 90 HP YAMAHA Motor that really gets up and goes! It even comes with a heavy duty Bunk Pontoon Trailer that was originally made for this pontoon boat. This pontoon boat was completely refurbished a year and a half ago. It had a new marine grade plywood deck put on it with new carpet at that time along with a new steering consul and all new high quality furniture with a lot of cup holders. The boat lights and stereo were completely rewired and it had a new Stereo installed in it. It has a comfortable L-shaped Sofa in the back with a Recliner on one side, a very good Captain's Chair and 2 good Swiveling Fish Seats up front. All of the furniture is in excellent condition without any cuts, tears, holes, cracks or fading. It can comfortably seat 7 to 9 people depending on their age, size and weight. There is storage space inside all the bench seats. It has a good live well in the middle. I ordered a new heavy duty Bimini Top for it that is not pictured in these photos because it was back ordered. The railing is in good condition. It has the lower fishing railing which makes it easier to lift fish over the railing or to lean over it to net any big fish. This boat was originally manufactured in 1987 as was the trailer. The pontoons are still in very good condition. We pressure tested both of them and they do not have any leaks. It was in use all summer long and was driven onto the bunk trailer it is pictured on this fall. It comes with a used 2000 Oil Injected YAMAHA 90 HP 2-Stroke Motor that is in excellent condition. It has power trim and tilt and a long shaft, which is ideal for pontoon boats. I was told by the previous owner that it can easily pull kids of any age and weight on tubes and can even pull water skiers! I put it in a local lake in late October and it started right up and ran great. We could start it up for you; but it's been winterized. It has been set up with 2 gas tanks with a fuel line for each one and includes a battery so it will be all ready to use in the spring. It has a clear title without any liens on it. I sold all the pontoon boats we refurbished this year other than the ones we finished late this fall and winter which are currently posted on Minneapolis Craigslist. You can check them out by entering: ""Pontoon Boat Remer MN"" or ""Refurbished Pontoon Boat"" in Minneapolis or Duluth Craigslist or by simply clicking on the link: ""more ads by this user"" on the right side of this posting. Please Note: You can buy this pontoon boat and motor without a trailer for $8000 or with the good used bunk trailer it is pictured on for $9000. I can have it shrink wrapped and/or store it for the winter or deliver it anywhere within 300 miles for free if you buy it this winter. If you are looking at pontoon boats at this time of the year, you must know this is the best time of the year to buy one; but the worst time of the year to sell them. That is why you can save $1000 from what I can sell it for in the spring... if you buy it now. You can look at it anytime, even in the evenings or on weekends, if I know when to meet you there. It is located in my shop in the small town of Remer in north central Minnesota, which is 250 miles from Rochester, 160 miles north of Minneapolis, 100 miles west of Duluth, 60 miles from Brainerd and Bemidji, 30 miles from Grand Rapids and Walker and 270 miles from the Iowa border.
