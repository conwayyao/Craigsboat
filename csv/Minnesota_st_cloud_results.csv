41,excellent,[],2016-12-15 05:27,"Nice Little 16' PALM BEACH Fish and Cruise Pontoon Boat with a 25 HP EVINRUDE Motor and a good Spartan Bunk Style Pontoon Trailer. This boat is ideal for all the smaller lakes and rivers in the upper mid-west. It can easily be towed with a 4 or 6 cylinder car, small truck or SUV. This boat is in excellent condition because it was always stored inside a shed year around whenever it wasn't in use. And it never was used very much because it was owned by a hard working family farmer who did not own any lake property so he had to trailer it whenever he had time to use it, which he said wasn't very often. There is a nice bench seat in the back and 2 good swiveling fish seats in front so it seats 4 or 5 people. It includes a nearly new fish locator/depth finder. It has a live well that works well. There is a radio with an antenna. It includes a portable swim ladder that can be attached on the front deck as well as one side. It has two side gates and a gate in the front. The railing is in very good condition. It has the lower fishing rails around the front half, which make it easier to lift fish into the boat or net bigger fish. It has a very solid marine grade deck with carpet that's in excellent condition. The deck is 6' wide by 14' long; but the pontoons are actually 16 feet long so it is titled as a 16 foot boat. It has a good bimini top. Both pontoons are in excellent condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. It has a good used 1999 25 HP EVINRUDE 2-Stroke Motor with power trim and tilt. The motor has a long shaft, which is ideal for pontoon boats. I've had the motor checked out, tuned up and started up by a marine mechanic since we refurbished this boat. It started right up and ran real good! We could start it up for you; but it has been winterized. It includes a battery and an extra large 12 gallon gas tank so it's all ready to use in the spring. I paid $150 for 2 brand new tires we put on this trailer, and it has a used spare tire as well. I have 3 other small refurbished pontoon boats currently available as well as several bigger ones. You can check them out by entering: ""Pontoon Boat Remer MN"" or ""Refurbished Pontoon Boat"" in Minneapolis Craigslist or by clicking the link: ""more ads by this user"" on the right side of this posting. Please Note: I had it shrink wrapped since these photos were taken; but I can cut a slit so you can look inside it. If you buy it now, I'll even store it for the winter or deliver it anywhere in Minnesota for free. If you are looking at pontoon boats at this time of the year, you must know this is the best time of the year to buy one; but the worst time of the year to sell them. That's why you can save $1000 from what I can sell this boat, motor and trailer for in the springtime. You can look at it anytime, even in the evenings or on the weekends, if I know when to meet you. It is located behind my shop in the small town of Remer in north central Minnesota, which is 120 miles from St Cloud, 30 miles from Grand Rapids and Walker, 60 miles from Brainerd and Bemidji, 160 miles north of Minneapolis, 100 miles west of Duluth, 140 miles east of Fargo and 230 miles from Mankato. Thank you for considering my pontoon boats and I hope to talk with you sometime soon.

This boat will look like new when it's on the water; but it costs less than new ones like this cost nowadays. We put all New Pontoon Furniture on this boat, including a New Steering Consul, New Captain's Chair, New L-shaped Sofa in the back and 2 New Swiveling Fish Seats up front so it can seat from 5 to 8 people depending on their age, size and weight. We put a New Deck with 3/4 inch Marine Grade Plywood and New Heavy Duty Marine Vinyl on it. The Vinyl Flooring dries much quicker than carpet does, is a lot easier to clean and maintain than carpet, and doesn't get moldy like carpet so easily does. We also put a Brand New Heavy Duty Bimini Top on that provides shade for most of the boat. The railing are in very good condition. Both pontoons are in excellent condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. It has an excellent 2004 15 HP MERCURY 4-Stroke Motor with Power Trim and Tilt. This pontoon boat was on a lake and in use last summer. It was driven onto this trailer this fall when I got it on a trade in on a bigger pontoon boat. We have started it up since we refurbished the boat and it started right up and ran real well. It runs very quiet and smooth and clean, and it will always get great gas mileage! We could start it up for you; but it has been winterized. It includes a new battery and new gas tank so it's all ready to use in the spring. It comes with a hard to find Aluminum Bunk Style Pontoon Trailer that is in excellent condition. This light weight pontoon boat and trailer can easily be towed with a 4 or 6 cylinder car, small truck or any size SUV. We put 2 New Tires on the trailer and kept a used one for a spare. This little pontoon boat is ideal for all of the smaller lakes and rivers in the upper mid-west and the trailer is ideal for people who have to frequently trailer their boat because they do not own lake shore property or have a boat lift or slip. All the lights on the boat and trailer work. This boat is currently registered until 2019 and the trailer has a lifetime registration sticker on it.

Parts can be obtained from either Bombardier or Suzuki.  Engine was meticulously tuned to the boat and has a mercury High 5 prop which produces great control and awesome back trolling performance. Walleye Master splash guards are excellent for use during back trolling. I originally had a different brand on there and they were not satisfactory. I also have the original Suzuki stainless prop that came with the boat. Both props are stainless and both are in virtually new condition.  There are no electric trolling motors as I fish Lake of the Woods exclusively and the trolling performance of this boat is so good that they are not needed.  Originally I had both a bow mount and transom electric and I just never used them. I took both motors off along with 2 batteries and saved a considerable amount of weight. All wiring is still there so you could easily put on whatever trolling motors you think you might need.  There is also a Panther kicker mount on the back to mount an electric there. The Suzuki 115 is the best motor you could ever want on the back of this boat. It trolls great and still pushes this hull very very nicely.  I have never regretted this engine choice for 1 second. There is absolutely no wood in the construction of this hull, so you know you are getting a solid boat.  It has never been abused and is in fantastic condition. Single axle Ranger trailer in great condition as well. A recent model Lowrance sonar/GPS is mounted.  Also includes a custom mounted marine radio and antenna. email me your phone number if you would like to discuss further, or use email if you wish",,5905142240,45.479500,20,-93.968400,Ranger,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@45.479500,-93.968400,16z",620T,$21000,power," (Clear Lake, MN)",Ranger 620 Tiller,https://stcloud.craigslist.org/boa/5905142240.html,2003

94,like new,"['45.310873', '-94.299774']",2016-12-04 08:04,"Lowered price! It gets shrink wrapped this week and want it gone. Need cash for another venture!  I would consider partial trade for a less expensive boat package, jon boat, or fish house. This is a great boat and an amazing deal. The new price on this package (boat, motor, electronics, trailer) is about $28,000. Here's the story of this boat. It was brand new this spring, but was slightly damaged in shipping. I purchased it in June and have been fishing in it since for a total of about 50 hours. Everything is in great shape except for several dings in the body that do not affect the performance of the boat at all. The six dings in the boat are all shown in the last 6 photos attached, with the biggest one first. The best thing about this boat is that it is aluminum, which makes it light, less expensive than fiberglass, more durable, and more easily repaired. A guy could easily pound out the biggest two dents from the inside, but it didn't change how the boat worked at all, so I didn't feel a need to do it. The boat is 18' 8"" and has a 115 Evinrude 2-stroke. Top speed is just under 50 mph with me in the boat. It includes two Lowrance locators (Elite 3x and 5x), the Minnkota Edge 80lb trolling motor, three batteries, on board charger, live well, lights, two pedestal seats, and tons of lockable storage. It also comes with a custom snap-on cover (shown in pictures) I just had made in August for $1,200.
