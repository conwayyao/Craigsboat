Why in the hell am I selling this awsome boat !  The answer is Time :(   In 9.8 years we can retire ( I PRAY) the fuel burn is great !  but the 7.5 mph is killing us. Right after the tank inspection we filled her up ( and treated with the best on the market) Weekend BBQ and sleep overs have been Great!  We run her almost every week end and a few 10 hour trips to Clear water has been great. Almost 2 years of weekend warrior running and we still have right under 3/4 tanks of fuel left in both. We need something a little faster, our slip is only $100.00 a month in a real secure aera , but on sight and beach play time is really short. So partial trades for a smaller express cruser are more than welcome and an option to purchase her back in nine years or so would also be great!
