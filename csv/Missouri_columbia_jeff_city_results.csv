The 375V is 17' 10"" long, has a 88"" beam, and twin 12 gallon tanks in the rear. Honestly... the seats are the worst part of this boat. Dont get me wrong, they are VERY usable, but the seams are giving way due to age, and I know cosmetics are important to a lot of people, so I wanted to state that up front. Everything on this boats works, and works well, that I am aware of. Thats not a way to side step anything, it just means that I have yet to this day, to throw a switch, and have something fail to work. Everything below is new and recently installed. Brand New: Minn Kota Terrova 80/24/45""/US2 trolling motor with remote (used once) Ram Mount TM Bounce Buster Helix 7 Sonar/GPS (Never used) Ram Mount for Helix 7 (can be spun around and faced forward when fishing) Minn Kota 330 Onboard Charger TH Marine Motor Trim Switch (these boats came without trim switches at the rear of boat) Splashwell Port W/Cover (To Access Charger Cord) Rear Boat Buckles Rod Buckle (Front Deck -- Starboard Side) Hydraulic Cylinder Type Motor Support (Also comes with traditional transom saver) Fulton Winch & Strap Winch Roller Keel Saver LED Tail Lights 1 -- 12V Power Ports 2 -- Fold-up Drink Holders I also have over 3/4's of a gallon of Evinrude/Johnson XD30, 2 stroke oil, which is what has always been run in the motor. I also have a bottle of Mercury Quickleen and a bottle of Starton concentrated. I ran the Quickleen and Startron in any gas I put in the boat. It has a 3 blade stainless prop and will run 55mph (GPS) loaded down. Im not going to lie to you like most do, and tell you this 150HP motor, will push this older, heavier hull 65 -- 70mph. Its never going to happen. But this boat planes out good and handles great. Not saying you couldnt get more out of it if you tweak it etc... But without any motor jack or tweaking, it will run 55 easy when loaded. It also comes with a 4 blade stainless prop, if you want to use it to ski/tube etc... This boat/motor/trailer has over $2,500 in brand spanking new parts alone. I am asking $5,250 for it and I am firm on price as the boat/motor/trailer alone is worth $3,500 - $4,500 without all the new equipment. If you are reading this, its still for sale. No low ball offers, no trades, and I dont need help selling it. I have all 3 clean Missouri titles in hand, ready to go to the first person who has the cash!

62,excellent,,2016-12-04 17:40,"1990 Baretta Phaser 230 O.B. 22'6"" fiberglass hull. Has a Volvo Penta AQ231A (305 Chevrolet V8) with a SP-A outdrive.  Boat seats 8, has factory tinted windows. Bimimi top. Also has another cover to put between the passage to the bow. Keeps wind from blowing through. The boat has 2 built in coolers. Originally had 3 I still have the third if desired. I was going to add multiple batteries with a loud stereo. Never really found the time to do it.There is ski storage in the bottom of the boat. Both of the center seats fold down flat for laying out. Also two 6' people could lay down flat in the front two seat in the bow. The boat has power steering and hydraulic trim. Everything about the boat works. Lights, gauges, ect. Could use a stereo upgrade. The interior is in great shape. Could use a cleaning. I haven't used the boat since the last part of July. So its kinda dirty. The boat has a 30 gallon fuel tank and in my opinion where this boat really shines is it's fuel mileage. At cruising rpms between 3,000-3,500 (30ishmph) depending on your load, this boat really sips gas. I have friends with smaller boats and smaller engines with bigger tanks and they use a lot more gas. I bought it from it's original owner. He kept it at the lake either on a lift or in a garage it's whole life. There is a fiberglass swim platform that's built into rear of the boat. Fresh engine and out drive oil. Seawater impeller is a year old.  Brand new full MSD ignition system. I have 4 props to go with this boat. all 4 are aluminum. 2 of them are 21 pitch volvo high speed props. One of them I run on the river and the other I run on lakes. The other props are a 19 pitch. I used these for a better holeshot for pulling a tube or somebody on skis or heavy loads. The boat is overall pretty good shape for being a 1990. I have A cover with pole supports for it. It also comes with a rolco trailer with new tires on it. 2"" ball, new jack. Roughly around 800 miles on the tires. If I can't sell it, that is fine. I've tried to be upfront with everything about the boat. It really is a good ole boat. If you can think of something don't hesitate to ask. The upper gearbox on the outdrive was rebuilt in June of 2016. It needed a cone clutch. While it was apart it was rebuilt with new parts. I also had new bellows and seals installed. Spent right at $2,000 doing that and using all Genuine Volvo parts. I don't know what the boat book out for but I know what I want for it with the parts. Haven't used the boat enough this year to depreciate much. I have new bumpers and life jackets to go with it. Texting will probably be the best way to get a hold of me. I work 12 hour shifts and work on a 2 week work schedule.$5800.00 The boat has $5,800 worth of fun and enjoyment left in it.
