51,,[],2016-12-10 13:31,"Why do folks need storage buildings? All kinds of reasons! ........Such as a place to store mowers and tools; to reduce clutter and make more room in their home or garage; to keep boxes for seasonal items easily accessible; to store boats, bicycles, motorcycles and cars; create a workshop; start a small business; to store craft materials or collectibles; for a kid's playhouse, a chicken house, a tiny house, a cabin at the lake....All kinds of reasons!......Now, why invest in a Cook portable Warehouse? First and foremost, our buildings are superior to our competitors, mostly in material, features and design. Our buildings are designed and backed with service to last a lifetime. We are the oldest manufacturer of storage sheds and we have been in business for over 32 years! We have learned over this time what works and what doesn't! Cook promises superior service starting with courteous, knowledgeable sales utilizing a low pressure, consultative approach. Cook employs experienced delivery/setup personnel, not independent contractors (ask yourself: who is going to be in my back yard?) who have passed background checks, drug tests, and a battery of reviews. Cook offers unmatched warrantees. Such as a lifetime warranty on the entire floor system and all areas of exposed exterior wood, a 30 year roof warranty, and a 5 year ""Bumper to Bumper"" warranty. We service our own warranties in the unlikely event a claim is necessary. Other companies send you to hassle with the manufacturer of the problem material. You can buy a cheaper shed, but be prepared to watch it fall apart pretty quickly. Is it really cheaper if it doesn't last and you are looking to replace it in several years? We believe people want quality, and most importantly, value. And that's what Cook offers! Cook has Rent-to-Own leases with deposits that generally range from $200-$300, and reasonable, affordable monthly terms. Our buildings are assembled locally, employing our neighbors and supporting our communities. Cook also supports multiple charities, and we have a dedicated branch of our company called ""Cook Cares"" who oversee philanthropic endeavors. ......These are some strong reasons to choose Cook Portable Warehouses for an investment and an improvement to your home or property. We are open Tuesday through Saturday, 9:30 am to 5:30 pm. And if you want to compare, come by my lot at 2603 N. Range Line Road, Webb City, MO 64836 (Zora and Range Line), take 10 minutes to learn about our product, pick up a brochure that has our ""Dare to Compare"" checklist on back, and go see what other choices you have in our area. I truly believe you will realize that we offer the best product available for your dollar, with the best service and warranties. Thanks for reading!

No need for lake house or camper to haul around, everything you need is on this boat. Has bathroom with toilet, sink, and shower. Also has shower head with hot and cold water out on swim deck. Hot water heater that runs off electric or motor heat either one. Large fresh water tank as well.  Sleeps 6. Kitchen has Corian solid surface, very nice. Also with sink, refrigerator, stove and microwave. Also has wraparound couch area with table in cabin that makes into a bed. Also in the cabin are a brand new Clarion Bluetooth marine stereo and 6 disc cd changer which plays in cabin and cockpit. Also has tv and DVD player in cabin. Has almost new 350 Mercruisers and rebuilt drives professionally done. Over $17,000 put into the new motors and drives to make them like new again. Less than 100 hours on them. The boat itself is 700+ hours. Also has an onboard generator to run the entire boat electrical system when not docked. As well as two 30 amp shore power plugs. Also has cabin air conditioner as well as heat and they both work great. Also has power windlass anchor system which is very handy. This boat will get up and move if you need to. Nice cruise speed is 30-35 but will easily do 45-50 if necessary. Both drives have power tilt and there are also dual hydraulic trim tabs to help stabilize uneven loads etc. We keep the Bimini top up on it, but it also has a full enclosure that can be zipped and buttoned on for cooler or wet weather so you can use more months of the year. Also has a snap on cockpit canvas cover that matches. Also has led light system that has several functions and colors that light up the cockpit nicely. They can also be dimmed or made to change colors to the music etc. Not pictured is a nice big matching cushion that goes up on the bow and is large enough for two people to lay out on to tan etc. I am sure I am missing a lot of things as there is so much on this boat but feel free to ask questions.  If you are considering a larger boat, you won't find one better taken care of and as good of quality for the price. It is definitely the best riding boat I've ever been in by far and Chaparral knows how to build them.  And having two motors/drives, it is a lot easier to maneuver as you can drive it like a zero turn mower when moving around the docks etc., unlike a single engine that can be a pain to move a big boat around with. The duals are extremely easy to drive. This does not come with a trailer as it is really too big to haul around and is much easier to use more often when you can just drive right to it already in the water. Boat is located on table rock in a rented slip, but can be transported very reasonably if you go to another lake. Take advantage of the season and save thousands off from book value. $19,900.
