I am the second owner, I purchased this boat from the original owner that had only had this boat on the water 10 times over his 10 years of ownership. I have owned this boat 3 years and yes I bought it to use, but boat is in fine condition. This boat is absolute perfect for a family. When staying at the lake Im on the water at day-break, fish til 10 then its only take 10 minutes to switch boat over to the water sport activites for the kids. This boat is ABSOLUTLY comfortable with my family of 6 , and tops out at 46.2 mph loaded with family. Serious inquires call and we might be able to arrange a little crappie fishing for opportunity to test the boat.
