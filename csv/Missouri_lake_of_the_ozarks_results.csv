Dont get me wrong, they are VERY usable, but the seams are giving way due to age, and I know cosmetics are important to a lot of people, so I wanted to state that up front. Everything on this boats works, and works well, that I am aware of. Thats not a way to side step anything, it just means that I have yet to this day, to throw a switch, and have something fail to work. Everything below is new and recently installed.

I also have a bottle of Mercury Quickleen and a bottle of Starton concentrated. I ran the Quickleen and Startron in any gas I put in the boat. It has a 3 blade stainless prop and will run 55mph (GPS) loaded down. Im not going to lie to you like most do, and tell you this 150HP motor, will push this older, heavier hull 65 -- 70mph. Its never going to happen. But this boat planes out good and handles great. Not saying you couldnt get more out of it if you tweak it etc... But without any motor jack or tweaking, it will run 55 easy when loaded. It also comes with a 4 blade stainless prop, if you want to use it to ski/tube etc... This boat/motor/trailer has over $2,500 in brand spanking new parts alone. I am asking $5,250 for it and I am firm on price as the boat/motor/trailer alone is worth $3,500 - $4,500 without all the new equipment. If you are reading this, its still for sale.
