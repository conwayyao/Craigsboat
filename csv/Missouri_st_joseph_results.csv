Background: As you read this, you will discover that we have put a lot of effort into this boat, we did not plan on selling it so we prepared it for the 2016 summer season and used it all summer long. Why are we selling it? On our last boating weekend of the season, we saw a larger boat that was priced to sell fast, and would accommodate our growing family. We purchased the newer boat on the spot. Very low maintenance, very easy to maintain yourself including oil change, winterize etc.. Will likely fit in your home garage. This is a very nice, well maintained luxury sport boat.  We are the third owners since new.  Purchased from a friend that owned it for 7 years, we have owned it for 6 years.  Recently purchased a larger boat with my brother.

Savannah MO, The new engine Is more powerful and more fuel efficient than the old motor. The old motor had a defect in it that was identified when we pulled it out of storage this year so we replaced the motor with the intent on keeping the boat for several more years. 60 gallon capacity fuel tank, this normally takes us a month to use with weekend boating at smithville.
