This is the 1854 extreme center counsel model with trim and forward/reverse all on the new mercury controls ( which is a new option for 2016). The GatorTail extreme hull is designed to be the best performing rig on the market today. The speed and handling of this rig is unbelievable. This rig is loaded with options. It has dual rod boxes that go all the way to front deck so you can fit a lot more stuff than other boat boxes that a deceivingly smaller once they are opened. Enclosed rear deck that is absolutely huge. You can easily fit 5 dozen decoys in this rear deck. A seat base with a very nice tempress brand seat is on top of the enclosed rear deck. 12 gallon fuel tank up front under the extended deck, bilge pump, and even more storage under the front deck. There is literally a spot for everything to be put away. Motor is the new GTR 37EFI. This combo is the best of the best. Boat will run 31mph with single person in it and the most impressive part is that even if you load this up with 4 hunters and all the gear you will still run 27+ mph which is really good numbers for a mudmotor. Boat sits on a very nice Mcclain aluminum trailer. I have this rig discounted down below my dealer price in order to make room for incoming inventory. I also have new 37EFI motors in stock.

38,,,2016-12-20 00:07,"I have for sale a 1986 Ranger 375V. It has a strong running 1986 Johnson GT150 that is just a few years from a fresh rebuild. It all sits on a 2000 Ranger Trail trailer. The 375V is 17' 10"" long, has a 88"" beam, and twin 12 gallon tanks in the rear. Honestly... the seats are the worst part of this boat. Dont get me wrong, they are VERY usable, but the seams are giving way due to age, and I know cosmetics are important to a lot of people, so I wanted to state that up front. Everything on this boats works, and works well, that I am aware of. Thats not a way to side step anything, it just means that I have yet to this day, to throw a switch, and have something fail to work. Everything below is new and recently installed. Brand New: Minn Kota Terrova 80/24/45""/US2 trolling motor with remote (used once) Ram Mount TM Bounce Buster Helix 7 Sonar/GPS (Never used) Ram Mount for Helix 7 (can be spun around and faced forward when fishing) Minn Kota 330 Onboard Charger TH Marine Motor Trim Switch (these boats came without trim switches at the rear of boat) Splashwell Port W/Cover (To Access Charger Cord) Rear Boat Buckles Rod Buckle (Front Deck -- Starboard Side) Hydraulic Cylinder Type Motor Support (Also comes with traditional transom saver) Fulton Winch & Strap Winch Roller Keel Saver LED Tail Lights 1 -- 12V Power Ports 2 -- Fold-up Drink Holders I also have over 3/4's of a gallon of Evinrude/Johnson XD30, 2 stroke oil, which is what has always been run in the motor. I also have a bottle of Mercury Quickleen and a bottle of Starton concentrated. I ran the Quickleen and Startron in any gas I put in the boat. It has a 3 blade stainless prop and will run 55mph (GPS) loaded down. Im not going to lie to you like most do, and tell you this 150HP motor, will push this older, heavier hull 65 -- 70mph. Its never going to happen. But this boat planes out good and handles great. Not saying you couldnt get more out of it if you tweak it etc... But without any motor jack or tweaking, it will run 55 easy when loaded. It also comes with a 4 blade stainless prop, if you want to use it to ski/tube etc... This boat/motor/trailer has over $2,500 in brand spanking new parts alone. I am asking $5,250 for it and I am firm on price as the boat/motor/trailer alone is worth $3,500 - $4,500 without all the new equipment. If you are reading this, its still for sale. No low ball offers, no trades, and I dont need help selling it. I have all 3 clean Missouri titles in hand, ready to go to the first person who has the cash!
