I would sell this boat for 3300.00 cash. So here's the good parts. I have all new parts to build a new motor. all machine work is done and engine internals are sitting in boxes. rods are already mounted to pistons. I also have new exhaust manifolds for it as well. I just had a new 600.00 cover made for boat. Has 400.00 worth of upholstery done. Trailer has new wiring and lights. I wired it correctly, i installed wiring back into frame and not zip tie it to outside of frame like previous owner did. Tires are in good shape . Also has a spare and spare rack mounted to tongue.
