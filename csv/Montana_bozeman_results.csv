Lights all work. The trim gauge on the dash doesn't work. Supposedly the engine was overhauled a couple years ago, no records, just words. It'll do 35 on smooth water. The fish finder may to need to be replaced, that's up to you, some of the lines in the screen don't work any more.  I just used if for depth and speed any way, it beeped all the time, supposedly fish, but never learned how to work that part.  Maybe if I learned how to use it, I'd be a better ""Catcherman"".  I just enjoy being on the water.  The only reason I take my cell phone is so I can Bluetooth it to the radio and listen to sweet tunes while I'm not catching anything (I post a lot of sunset pictures on FB, but not a lot of fish). After much deliberation, we bought this last spring to decide if we are ""Boat People"" or not.  We have always enjoyed going out on the water with our friends that have a big nice boat.  Well, we are ""Boat People"" so, we are getting a bigger boat as soon as the right one pops up (after I finish building my barn this winter to put it in).  This one goes and handles very well but, my wife likes the stability of a bigger boat and I like the idea of having a fuel injected big motor with a kicker if the big motor quits.  I have never worked on these small Johnsons and am not really inclined to learn.  We also want a big enough boat to camp out of. Overall, the boat served its purpose.  It is a great little boat and I really enjoy it.  One thing we will miss is leaving it attached to our Jeep Wrangler, get home, jump in and head for the lake, and be on the water in no time without the hassle of a larger vessel.

92,,,2016-11-07 08:18,"I have a flat-bottom aluminum jet boat that I used for fishing and hunting.  I bought it from the guy who built it in 2004 and have had it up and down many miles of the Missouri,  from Headwaters to Canyon Ferry, Lower Holter to just below Hauser, below Great Falls, below Fort  Peck....miles and miles. It's a bigger boat than a typical jon-boat.  It is ~17  ft long, and the bottom is ~5 ft wide.  The sides have reinforced ribs and come up at an angle for a total depth of ~28 inches.  Since the sides come up at an angle, the boat it more like ~7 ft wide at the top.  It is incredibly stable on the water....impossible to flip. At some point I came across a spare motor and pump for it, so I bought that in case I were to ever need it.  I believe that the original motor was late 70's vintage, and the spare was similar.  The original 80 hp motor ran really strong, and presumably it still would.  But about 4 years ago I replaced the throttle and steering linkage and a few other things.  Apparently I didn't get the linkage from the throttle to the pump secured well enough and it came apart the next time I took it out.  With the linkage disconnected, I had no control and the motor threw itself around a bit before I got it shut down.  It's been a while and my memory isn't perfectly clear, but I think it was something on the exterior of the motor was bent or broken...I think points, distributor cap.  The housing they were in was somehow damaged.  I couldn't find anyone that could work on it around here, so I took it off and put the spare motor / pump on.  It worked great at first, but before long I lost compression in one of the cylinders on the spare motor. This boat is nothing to look at...but was great for accessing lots of miles of great hunting and fishing.  Unfortunately, I am at a point in life with my work and family where I don't have enough time to get on the river...can't justify owning it (even  it were running).  I can send you a video of running it on the Missouri from a few years ago if you're interested. So there you have it...one boat (no leaks), two motors / pumps.  If you can fix the original motor (shouldn't be that hard for someone who knows these older motors).  Asking $3,500 for everything, but open to offers.  I'm told that these pumps alone are worth ~$1,000 each. ***I will post photos as soon as I can find them.
