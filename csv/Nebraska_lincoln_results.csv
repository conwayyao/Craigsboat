I purchased the boat in 1996 from a couple in Omaha.  Boat had been used as the little knobs on new tires were still visible when I got the boat.

Boat comes with two fish finders -- one with the original boat -- a Garmin Fishfinder 240 and a Lowrance  LMS-337CDF fishfinder with GPS.  Trolling motor is a Tracker Pro Motor Guide. There is a live well with aerator, bilge pump, ice chest, ten gallon fuel tank and a stainless steel prop. Tires are in excellent condition.

The trailer had the bearings packed and one set of shoes replaced in June of 2015, tires were replaced in 2012.

I would prefer to keep my trailer and lower my price, also could lower the price if someone didn't need the generator.
