Not that you'll be lacking in the storage area as there is space under each front seat as well as seating in the rear. There is also a ton of space in the floorboard for ski's, wakeboard, fishing equipment, etc. The wakeboard racks are handy when out on the water to make retrieving them quick and easy. There are 2 built in coolers (one in front and one in the rear) as well as an onboard sink and 10 gallons of fresh water capacity. The sound system sounds great turned up when your skier is in tow.

It is just starting to get broke in .  The carbs are rebuilt . fuel tank cleaned. Was professional winterized at the yamaha shop.  Look up the SBT website and look up the 1200 engine , I got the premium model. The ski starts and runs great . Has enough power to pull a skier with two people on it . The horse power rating is 155  . Seats three people. The trailer is included. There is only 2 scrapes on the hull. Call or text with questions. It has a new battery last summer.
