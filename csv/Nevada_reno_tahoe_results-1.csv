Last year I went to start it up and noticed the intake cracked during transit the prior summer. What caused the intake to crack was a loose air filter assembly which put stress on the intake. I ordered replacement intake and installed half-assed without getting new gaskets and sealer (old gaskets from old intake is currently installed). Oil from the oil tank also leaked into bottom of hull. I think that's from me not tightening down a hose tight enough when I installed new intake. Before starting, the new buyer will need to remove and reinstall intake just to make sure everything is good to go, and clean up oil that leaked into the hull. This is a strong running Sea Doo (starts with one push of button and stays started) that was taken care of very well. I just don't have time or mechanical skills to get everything back to factory spec after intake cracked.
