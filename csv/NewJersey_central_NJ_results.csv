It is fully loaded 90 horsepower convince package 2 up model. Like I said the ski is in immaculate condition and was maintained meticulously always washed and flushed after every single ride and has never stayed over night in salt water. The trailer is included in the sale it is a Sealion single trailer that was also well taken care of wheel bearings always greased and full led lights. The reason for selling is simply because I will not have the time to get out and ride next season. I am asking $6,000 any questions please feel free to contact me.
