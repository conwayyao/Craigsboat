Finishing the competition in 22/30 boats. Not exactly the greatest finish ever but she still managed to beat BRAND NEW boats. So if you are looking for a way to get into the F-18 class there is no need to go out and buy the newest boat when this boat will take you there. The sailor makes the boat not the other way around, something that I had to remind a few sailors at nationals about. Custom Trailer and beach wheels included! She is ready to sail and needs no work at all! This link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuMPPM1JyjA will bring you to a video of a training camp held before the F-18 Nationals (she is the boat with the red sails.). We had 4 boats racing a short course format in the video. You can see from the video that she has plenty of pace to keep up with the all of the other boats which are significantly newer and more expensive! Asking $5,000 for this intergalactic cruiser which I believe to be a fair price. I really do not wish to sell her but I have moved to Europe for University and do not have the time for her.

This classic keel centerboard day sailor/ weekender is mahogany planked  on sawn white oak frames with teak decks, mahogany coamings and bench seats with deck stepped spruce mast, boom and jib boom with a yammer diesel inboard. Solid build that would survey well. Very good in heavy air and shallow water. Never used the spinnaker. 26' overall with boom kin. 25"" draft board up, 4' down ( fiberglass).
