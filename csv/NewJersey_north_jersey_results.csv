These boats retail for over $20,000 new. They have excellent military spec build quality, super thick, tight weave, 3 layer hypalon fabric throughout which will last decades. Intercommunicating metal valves offer unsurpassed safety (8 chambers) and the ability to rapid inflate with a scuba tank. These boats are fast, stable, incredibly maneuverable due the use of ""Speed Tubes"" to their deep V hulls with inflatable keels. The perfect scuba platform. Rated for 10 people and equipment, but 4 to 6 is more realistic. These boats are capable of open ocean runs, River use and calmer waters. The military runs these with 55hp Enforcer Durajets, or the lighter 35hp motors. The transom is rated for 40hp. With either motor the boat quickly gets on plane. This is a short Shaft transom Zodiac. The boat is complete which is rare of these surplus, all the hardware, bowboard, speed tube clamps, etc are included. Aluminum slat, heavy duty roll up floor. The boat can be rolled out and inflated in only a few minutes. I transported this boat inside a two door hatchback Ford Focus, packs small for a 15 foot boat! I tried using it as a tender on my sailboat, but I decided to switch back to a smaller boat. Sad to see it go. Pictured you will note that a) the (optional) wooden board at the bottom of the transom needs to be painted black and b) There are a few of the D-ring patches on the floor and one on the tube which will need to be re-glued. This is a Youtube video of the boat the day it was rolled up and stored. (this past week): https://youtu.be/NfIfH0txfRw Boat is ready to go and be put on the water. Feel free to ask any questions.
