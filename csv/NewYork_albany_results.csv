It has Corsa captains call exhaust, extended swim platform, bimini top and complete enclosure all in near perfect condition. This is not your average captiva as it has many upgrades. The first being it was custom ordered without the front bow rail for a sportier look. I have done many upgrades as well. Upgraded Sony Bluetooth stereo with MB Quart amp, 10"" sub and 61/2"" speakers. Full shore power with battery charger, 2 batteries and bluesea switch and isolator. Also installed 110v outlets in the cabin as well as additional 12v outlets and a 19"" led tv/dvd combo. (TV is 12v) I added 3 color led underwater lights as well as a custom switch panel for additional lighting. The boat is in excellent condition with only some minor normal marks here and there. Comes with a 2005 shore lander roller bunk trailer with torsion suspension and disc brakes on both axles in excellent condition. Any questions feel free to call or text. 518-3three0-seven9five7.

Easy to enter and load with gear Easy to handle, designed by David Yost Pretty enough to get compliments, scuffed enough to have personality! Bought new from Placid in 2006, always stored inside . Weighed on my bathroom scale, it's 33 or 34 pounds; Placid rates it at 32 pounds. New price now for the whole package is somewhere north of $3600. The canoe is in Manhattan, but I can deliver it to the greater Albany area. Very good condition , despite eight seasons of frequent use (modest damage described below). Placid's description: http://placidboatworks.com/rapidfire.html Reviews: http://www.paddling.net/Reviews/showReviews.html?prod=1983 (My review is the one from 7-24-07, but that's for the boat used as a kneeling canoe, not as a deckless kayak.) Seats: Standard configuration from Placid includes one of their three molded carbon seats. I have the medium and the high seat, and I can install either of them permanently or give them both to you loose (they nest). Both are pictured. Spray cover: I will include Placid's bright-orange, custom nylon spray cover, which I never got around to installing, if you want it. Flotation bags: I installed attachment points along the sides and bottom of the boat, so I could put in flotation bags. I have removed the bags, and I plan to remove the attachment points, unless you want to buy them from me at a bargain price! That will probably take a pound off the boat's weight. Damage Hull: The hull is amazingly strong and has needed no repairs to the carbon or Kevlar, despite a few encounters with rocks. The off-white gelcoat on the bottom has many superficial white-on-white scratches and three very small white-on-white repairs. The clear gelcoat on the sides (through which the black carbon fiber shows) has many superficial scratches, only cosmetic, but rather noticeable. Wood: The wood is solid everywhere, no cracks. There is discoloration around screws and seams, enough to be unsightly but not enough to cause a structural problem. The mottled appearance in places is old damage from my banging the boat around, but it is now all dry, smooth, and sealed inside three layers of matte varnish (Minwax Helmsman Polyurethane Spar Varnish, satin sheen, to be precise). Rail screws: The screws near the center of one rail pulled out, leaving the inwale and outwale separated by 1/8 inch (pictured). This is nothing but a cosmetic problem if you plan to use the boat in the standard way, as a deckless kayak.",,5916364505,40.867444,15,-73.929577,Placid Boatworks,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@40.867444,-73.929577,16z",RapidFire,$1950,human,,Kevlar/carbon solo canoe -- 33 pounds -- Placid Boatworks RapidFire,https://albany.craigslist.org/boa/5916364505.html,2006
