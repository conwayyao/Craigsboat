I hunt waterfowl out of it occasionally and I'm selling it to get the new camouflage model they just released. It's in good condition, there are some scratches on the bottom from regular use, but nothing major. It's an awesome kayak for all kinds of fishing, waterfowl hunting, or if your just looking for something really stable to paddle and explore for pleasure. The seat has a low setting and a high setting that is comfortable for paddling all day. It has two flush mount rod holders, and four rod tubes next to the seat for storing rods. I also used a homemade milk crate behind the seat for carrying gear and to stow extra rods - its nothing special but I can include it if you'd like. There are hatches in the front and back for dry storage. The kayak is one of the most stable on the market (I usually stand while I'm fishing, and its much more stable than a small jonboat), has a weight capacity of 500lbs, paddles better than most kayaks geared towards fishing, and it is set up to allow you to use a trolling motor. I also have a Lowrance Elite-4x HDI Fishfinder/GPS that is currently on a Ram Mount, attached to the gear track on a Yakattack Screwball. The transducer is mounted inside hull, but everything is removable. If you're interested in buying the kayak and want to keep all of that on there, it's an extra $200. Nucanoe is a great brand, all made in Wisconsin. Please look around at reviews for the pursuit, I don't know if you'll find anyone with anything bad to say about it, here's an article that describes it very well... http://kayakfishingblog.com/2016/11/kayak-trends-moving-toward-performance-features/ And here is more information from the Nucanoe website: http://www.nucanoe.com/blog/pursuit-fishing-kayak/ I paid $1600 new, I'm selling for $1000.
