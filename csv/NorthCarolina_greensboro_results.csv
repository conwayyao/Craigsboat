6,,,2016-12-20 13:55,"I'd like to rent out my 36' boat slip (wet) at Bradley Creek Marina. I'm looking for $500 per month, along with a 12 month lease. Price is negotiable for more than a 1 year lease. It's in a great location at the marina, at Pier 1 (slip 39). This pier is on the inside basin and well protected. The slip is close to the bathhouse and shower facilities and has fantastic views of the adjacent Airlie Gardens. Bradley Creek Marina was voted ""Best Marina"" in Wilmington by readers of Encore Magazine. It's very close to the intercoastal waterway and less than 2 miles from the first buoy at Masonboro Inlet, saving you time and fuel. This is a big advantage of the Bradley Creek Marina versus the marinas at Carolina Beach, Hampstead or on the River. For comparison, the Masonboro inlet is 30 to 45 minutes by boat from the marina at Carolina Beach. Another big advantage of Bradley Creek is easy access to the marina itself. Since it's on the mainland, you don't have to fight beach traffic over the Wrightsville Beach bridge, which can be a big headache in the boating months. The marina itself is full-service and has been there since 1964. It has a clubhouse and a bathhouse. It's well protected from storms and hurricanes. Floating concrete docks and walkways offer optimum protection from storm surge. You can stay on your boat for extended weekends. However, you should know that they don't allow long-term live aboards. You can go to Bradley Creek's website (www.bradleycreekmarina.com) to check out the marina on line. If you have a boat smaller than 36 feet and are looking for a slip, we might be able to work a deal. According to folks at the marina (on 3/19/13), they only have a few 28' and 22' slips left for rent and they expect those to be gone soon. Drop me a note or give me a call if you want to talk further.  I'm eager to get it rented as I'm not going to be using it this season. As the owner, I can give you a better rate than the marina can. P.S - If you're interested, I'd consider selling this slip. According to marina personnel, the last 36' wet slip sold for $125,000. Since the board would have to approve any ownership transfer, the price would have to be somewhere in that ballpark. There's also a $750 transfer fee with annual membership dues of about $2000. We can discuss all of this if you're interested in a purchase. Tom Proctor show contact info",,5927057840,,36,,,,,,human,,36' Boat Slip For Rent,https://greensboro.craigslist.org/boa/5927057840.html,
