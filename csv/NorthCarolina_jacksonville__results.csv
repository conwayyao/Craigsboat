This boats draft is 4"" with two men and a dog. The previous owner spray foamed the boat in certain areas to give it more buoyancy. This boat can get in very skinny water. The motor runs excellent. Turns over every time and the boat will go close to 30 mph with two men and a dog. I have fresh water Minn Kota 52 thrust that came with the boat and a Minn Kota saltwater 48 thrust. Comes with a new trolling motor 12 volt battery. Bilge pump works great. I'm have it service and a new trim motor put on the engine as I write this. It wasn't being responsive like I wanted it to be so I replaced it. It also has a live well that was converted into storage. I am selling because my buddy is getting deployed and is selling the flats boat that I want and it is an upgrade.
