I purchased the boat after it had sat for a couple of years so i have replaced the following: NGK Spark Plugs Water Impeller Force Trim Tab Ignition Sqitch Thermostat, Cover Gasket Water Pump Boat Fuel Line Assembly 8ft Inline Fuel Filter Oem Fuel Filter Low Pressure Fuel Pump Cowl Decals Anchor Home Depot Trailor Rails w brackets Depth Meter Trailer bearings with hubs Trailer winch Trailer paint Cup holders Boat Bottom Paint Gas Tanks Trailer Tires The whaler comes with a brand new black bimini top, boat cover (can be used on the road), vests, fire extinguisher, fresh oil,oil filter and grease all around (incl. steering). The engine hums and the battery is always charged on a maintainer! The boat is stored always in a shade with the cover on. Washed after the few rides i have taken with it. Key ready for fun. Reason to sell: i have not taken it out nearly close to what expected. Need the money for home repair. I take pride in taking care of my vehicles - this boat makes no exception.
