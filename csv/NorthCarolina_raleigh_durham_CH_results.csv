15,,,2016-12-20 13:58,"I'd like to rent out my 36' boat slip (wet) at Bradley Creek Marina. I'm looking for $500 per month, along with a 12 month lease. Price is negotiable for more than a 1 year lease. It's in a great location at the marina, at Pier 1 (slip 39). This pier is on the inside basin and well protected. The slip is close to the bathhouse and shower facilities and has fantastic views of the adjacent Airlie Gardens. Bradley Creek Marina was voted ""Best Marina"" in Wilmington by readers of Encore Magazine. It's very close to the intercoastal waterway and less than 2 miles from the first buoy at Masonboro Inlet, saving you time and fuel. This is a big advantage of the Bradley Creek Marina versus the marinas at Carolina Beach, Hampstead or on the River. For comparison, the Masonboro inlet is 30 to 45 minutes by boat from the marina at Carolina Beach. Another big advantage of Bradley Creek is easy access to the marina itself. Since it's on the mainland, you don't have to fight beach traffic over the Wrightsville Beach bridge, which can be a big headache in the boating months. The marina itself is full-service and has been there since 1964. It has a clubhouse and a bathhouse. It's well protected from storms and hurricanes. Floating concrete docks and walkways offer optimum protection from storm surge. You can stay on your boat for extended weekends. However, you should know that they don't allow long-term live aboards. You can go to Bradley Creek's website (www.bradleycreekmarina.com) to check out the marina on line. If you have a boat smaller than 36 feet and are looking for a slip, we might be able to work a deal. According to folks at the marina (on 3/19/13), they only have a few 28' and 22' slips left for rent and they expect those to be gone soon. Drop me a note or give me a call if you want to talk further.  I'm eager to get it rented as I'm not going to be using it this season. As the owner, I can give you a better rate than the marina can. P.S - If you're interested, I'd consider selling this slip. According to marina personnel, the last 36' wet slip sold for $125,000. Since the board would have to approve any ownership transfer, the price would have to be somewhere in that ballpark. There's also a $750 transfer fee with annual membership dues of about $2000. We can discuss these issues in detail if you're interested in a purchase.

Not sure of the exact hours now but I would estimate the hours to be around 150 or less which is why I'm selling it. The boat has performed flawlessly during my ownership. I did have to replace the trolling motor battery last year. The ride is smooth and handles chop with ease. The top speed of the boat is a GPS verified speed of 62 mph. It definitely is not a Bullet boat but it is nice to pull away from hot shots in their $75K ski boat. The boat has never been in salt water. The Stratos 486 SF (sport fish) is a dual-purpose boat. On the bow is a foot-operated Minn-Kota variable speed trolling motor. The cushions on the bow are snapped in place and easily removed to provide ample deck space for fishing. Under the deck lids on the bow are rod lockers with holders mounted in place to store the fishing rods. There is also an AM/FM/CD radio with aux. input to plug in a smart phone or Ipod to play music through the speakers. The under floor storage compartment is large enough to hold water skis and wake boards and everything else that goes along with those sports. Under the middle rear seat is a built-in cooler with drain. The single seats next to the rear middle seat slide out to become the fisherman seats which mount to the decks. Behind the cooler on the rear deck is an aerated live well along with storage compartments on either side. The plug to the on-board dual bank battery charger is accessible by lifting the lid in front of the transom. Underneath the boat is an optional keel guard to protect the front of the boat from damage. Not only does the boat come with a ski pole which mounts on the rear deck, I purchased separately a TurboSwing tow bar made specifically for boats with outboards. The reason this tow bar is important is the ski pole which mounts into the rear deck IS NOT DESIGNED to pull a towable of which the tow rope is attached and only to be used to pull people that can let go of the tow rope. A tube for example has the rope attached to it and doesn't provide any ""give"" if nose-dived into a wave whereas a skier or wakeboarder's arms and body can provide give or act as the suspension. There have been multiple cases of ski poles being ripped out of the rear deck of boats with outboards (all boats with ski poles not just the Stratos) causing substantial damage. The TurboSwing is mounted to the transom and the tow rope attaches to a ""trolley"" which allows the rope to move from side to side allowing the tube to really move outside the wake with ease. The boat is powered by a Mercury 2-stroke V6 which I believe to be underrated at 150hp and has ""direct injection"" to provide more power and fuel economy. Also has a Sea Star hydraulic steering system. The boat rides on the original trailer that has surge brakes, swing-away tongue so it can fit in tight garages. It has oil-bath wheel bearings so no worries about having to grease the bearings every trip to prevent damage from shocking them by backing the trailer into cold water after getting hot from the trip. All lights on the trailer have been replaced with LED lights. Not shown in the pictures is the transom saver that is used every trip, the Bimini top which I have never put on the boat, or the boat cover. The boat has always been covered to keep out the blowing dust and dirt even though the boat sits under a shelter protecting it from the elements. This boat fit every desire I had when I was in the market for a boat. My hobbies have changed and I just don't fish like I used to. I spent a great deal of time trying to find this model boat which is why I had to drive to Virginia to purchase it. Do a search for the same model regardless of year and you'll see there are only a few for sale. Don't let this deal pass you by. This boat is in excellent shape and has been meticulously maintained just like everything I own. I have only ran 93 octane ethanol-free gas purchased from Holding oil in Wake Forest and always added marine formula Stabil fuel stabilizer. I swear by the stuff and use it in everything except the cars which is why I never have any fuel related issues with anything I own. I would be willing to tow the boat to a local mechanic of your choice to have it inspected at your expense which I recommend for your peace of mind. The mechanic can give you a computer print-out of engine hours and RPM band and the amount of time spent at different RPMs. I am also willing to meet you at the lake for a test drive. Contact me for more information.  Asking $15,000.  Will entertain offers.  Priced below low retail to move. If you are reading this the boat is still for sale.

This is a one owner boat that was traded-in on a new boat. It has a cuddy-cabin design with a sport hull. Perfect for a weekend excursion and watersports with the kids. Also, has a bimini top with a full enclosure for the bad weather days. Plenty of power with the V8 motor and ample room for storing skis, tubes, and other necessities. This is a true multi-purpose boat that can be used in all types of water and can handle the family outings. The cabin features include a port-a-potty and functional wet-bar/sink, nice v-berth sleeping accommodations, plus lighting and remote controlled stereo. The cabin is spotless with every square-inch maximized for comfort, plus a natural light hatch with forward deck access. Plenty of room to install a television or other entertainment items. Monterey has always been known as a high-end boat with no expense spared. There is comfortable seating for 5 on the main deck with molded steps in the cabin door to the walk-through windshield for sunbathing on the forward deck. The GPS/Depthfinder to show you the way when you are having too much fun. Woodgrain dash and sport-style steering wheel, plus the racing style captain's chair are part of what makes this a perfect boat for all occasions. The engine is a Volvo Penta 5.0L, V8 small block, with fuel injection. It has a new water pump, exhaust manifolds/risers, circulating pump, spark plugs/wires, distributor cap/rotor, alternator, battery, shift/throttle cables, thermostat, and new fuel delivery module (High/Low Pressure Fuel Pumps and Filter). This has been one of the best engines that Volvo has made in the last 20 years. The SX drive is about as bullet-proof as it gets. It has new gimble bearing and bellows on the outdrive, plus all new fluids in engine and drive. The fuel tank was cleaned a few months ago because of the ethanol fuel.

This boat was a repossession by a bank and has warranty till 2019. This model is the ""Cadillac"" of jet-powered wake boarding boats and has a retail of close to $50,000. Go buy a new one and in two months you will have this boat for ten thousand less. This is the cheapest one on the internet with Medallion and less than 40 hours. Half of the ones without the Medallion are more expensive and they do not even have the full stereo. Feel free to look around. It does not have a scratch on it and has been kept in a climate-controlled building its whole life, including now. It has a Polk Marine full stereo with 2-12 inch subwoofers, 2-6x9 mid-range, 2-2 inch tweeters, plus the Polk head unit and amplifier. The dash is Medallion Touch-Screen with ski-mode, eco mode, docking mode, and cruise mode. Each mode has certain settings for fuel-efficiency, RPM range, and a cruise control, along with vertical drive for controlled docking, which can be fun in a jet-boat. Also has built-in GPS, stereo controls, depth indicator, and more with the Medallion System. This jet-boat makes a Yamaha look like a Jon-boat, trust me! I've had both! Engine is Bombardier Rotax and is closed-cooling, which means no worries with the overheat during the summer days or salt-water corrosion. It has had the break-in service, fuel tank cleaning, full detail, and a system check, but other than that, it has not seen the light of day. It has a full-cockpit and bow cover, plus a towing-bimini top which keeps the captain and passengers shaded without blocking the view. Boat has great storage areas and will actually keep the cargo dry, unlike Yamaha boats. Just the material used for the seats and dash are of so much higher quality than the Yamaha boats. Keep in mind, there are two different models for this boat, one with the Medallion Touch-Screen and the one with just basic gauges. This is the one with the Medallion, which is like the difference between 4K Ultra HD television and a 80s model projection television. Chaparral boats hold their value as well as any smaller boat on the water, period, so the resell will not be an issue. ***The Pictures Do Not Do It Justice*** 1. 8 Person Capacity 2. 2600 Dry Weight 3. 35 Gallon Fuel Tank 4.
