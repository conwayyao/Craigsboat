I've had a mechanic on the island work on both motors and replace everything that wasn't working. He put a brand new lower end on one and put a new impeller in the other. I replaced all  fuel lines, filters, rebuilt the carbs, new starter, new solonoids, etc... I've had it in the water once since I bought it from Theresa Earnhardt. Yes race fans it belonged to her father. Due to family business I've not been able to use it or even break it in since the work done to it. It has sat for a couple years since I ran the motors last. One of the heads on one of the motors leaked a little water and I was told that may be just because I had it hooked to a hose with too much water pressure. It didn't do that when I ran it in the ocean. Compression tests on both motors show consistent and good pressure. But might need to repair or replace a head on one of the motors. I don't know. Both motors ran great last I started it. I only had the boat in the water a couple hours or so but the boat stayed completely dry. Not a drop came out when I pulled the plug. One of the fuel tanks leaked and I removed it to repair it but it still has the 50 gal tank in it and it's fine. If I finish repairing the other tank and the head work my price will go up a lot. I have a boat on Lake Norman where I spend most of my time. This boat is priced to sell quickly. You can call me at  7O4 65O-683O with questions or setup a time to see the boat. I have clear title on both boat and trailer. I'm taking a considerable loss but need to sell it. I'm asking 6k. I'll consider any reasonable offers but I have considerably more than that into it.

25,,,2016-12-20 13:53,"I'd like to rent out my 36' boat slip (wet) at Bradley Creek Marina. I'm looking for $500 per month, along with a 12 month lease. Price is negotiable for more than a 1 year lease. It's in a great location at the marina, at Pier 1 (slip 39). This pier is on the inside basin and well protected. The slip is close to the bathhouse and shower facilities and has fantastic views of the adjacent Airlie Gardens. Bradley Creek Marina was voted ""Best Marina"" in Wilmington by readers of Encore Magazine. It's very close to the intercoastal waterway and less than 2 miles from the first buoy at Masonboro Inlet, saving you time and fuel. This is a big advantage of the Bradley Creek Marina versus the marinas at Carolina Beach, Hampstead or on the River. For comparison, the Masonboro inlet is 30 to 45 minutes by boat from the marina at Carolina Beach. Another big advantage of Bradley Creek is easy access to the marina itself. Since it's on the mainland, you don't have to fight beach traffic over the Wrightsville Beach bridge, which can be a big headache in the boating months. The marina itself is full-service and has been there since 1964. It has a clubhouse and a bathhouse. It's well protected from storms and hurricanes. Floating concrete docks and walkways offer optimum protection from storm surge. You can stay on your boat for extended weekends. However, you should know that they don't allow long-term live aboards. You can go to Bradley Creek's website (www.bradleycreekmarina.com) to check out the marina on line. If you have a boat smaller than 36 feet and are looking for a slip, we might be able to work a deal. According to folks at the marina, they only have a few 28' and 22' slips left for rent and they expect those to be gone soon. Drop me a note or give me a call if you want to talk further.  I'm eager to get it rented as I'm not going to be using it this season. As the owner, I can give you a better rate than the marina can. P.S - If you're interested, I'd consider selling this slip. According to marina personnel, the last 36' wet slip sold for about $125,000. Since the board would have to approve any ownership transfer, the price would have to be somewhere in that ballpark. There's also a $750 transfer fee with annual membership dues of about $2000. We can discuss all of these details if you'd like to talk about a purchase.

96,excellent,[],2016-12-19 09:53,"Sadly selling this classic beauty. In really nice shape all original gel coat with 1983 35HP Evinrude. Engine has been gone through and used regularly by my 16 year old for fishing. He has moved into a bigger boat. I have had just about everything replaced on this motor, new carb kit, new wiring, new power packs , oils changed and never run on anything other than ethanol free gas since we have had it. Is it perfect? No. But she is a real head turner, and would make a superb boat for any youngster, or family needing an inexpensive and reliable, unsinkable, classic. 2005 Magic Tilt Trailer is in excellent shape, probably too much trailer for this boat. Freshly bottom painted in October with classic red hard coat..
