I've had it for three where I've used it in and around the coastal areas in ILM and lakes of VA, cruising/wakeboarding. Each and every use was followed by a proper flush and a wash from keel to topside. You will not find an early 2000s Bow rider in better condition, period. Coastal or inland.

43,,,2016-12-14 00:05,"1993 Trophy Bayliner For Sale or Trade. This is a solid running boat, looks good but it does need a few repairs. Looking to sale or trade for either a Pontoon or Bass boat. Full Details below: We replaced the engine a few years ago and it only has a few hours on it. It's a 150HP Mercury that runs out 100%. At the time, the new engine was over $9k. For serious inquires, I'll be glad to let you hear it run. The outside of the engine does need some new decals on it, as the ones on it have started to peel off. I've checked online and those can be replaced to look brand new for under $100.00. The boat is 21foot long with a cuddy cabin that sleeps two adults comfortably. It has the toilet in the cuddy, however it's missing a bolt and needs to be replaced (not sure of the costs). I currently have the toilet pulled out at the moment. All of the cushions for both inside and outside are in great condition. You might find a couple stains on the cushions in the cuddy but no cushions have holes, tears, etc. We've always taken the exterior cushions off the boat and kept them stored underneath when we weren't using it. The AM/FM radio had quit working the last time we used it, and the speakers needed to be replaced anyway so i pulled everything out and purchased new equipment. We have a brand new radio & speakers, but I have not had the time to install everything back. Everything will go with the boat. The boat also has a CB radio that is installed and works fine. I also have a practically brand new GPS and a new Transducer that needs to be mounted that we purchased from West Marine in 2013 (worth over $700). We've used it once. The transducer will need to be installed. The boat offers a livewell and the aerator works great. It also has two large floor ice chests built in. Windshields and zip up cover accessories come with boat. If i were planning to keep this boat i would want to eventually replace the dash (where all the controls are), as the buttons have faded. Everything works so I'm not sure if this could be repaired or if it would need to be replaced. Again, it works fine, just more of an appearance issue to me. The boat needs a new tire which we will purchase and put on prior to selling. The boat trailer is in excellent condition and all lights work just fine. This is a great fishing, skiing or touring boat. It's not perfect but it runs out 100% and just needs a bit of TLC. If you are someone who has the time and wouldn't mind working on the items mentioned above, then this boat is for you. If you have a Pontoon or Bass boat that you are looking to get rid of and are hoping to get in more of a boat built for saltwater fishing, this is the deal for you. I'm looking to do an even trade, so value needs to be equal or relatively close to asking price. Feel free to send me an email with what you have if the value is close to or at asking price. If you have a potential trade, please email me all details with any pictures you may have. If you're interested in buying this it outright, please call or text me at 33six-seven05-11four0. **Serious Inquires Only** Any emails asking for Paypal information will be reported.",,5918605472,,21,,,,,$8000,power, (Clemmons),1993 Bayliner Trophy Walkaround FS or Trade,https://winstonsalem.craigslist.org/boa/5918605472.html,
