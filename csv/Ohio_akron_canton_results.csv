2,good,,2016-12-20 18:54,"Hello, here I have a Wilderness Systems Pungo 120 Angler model in the Dusk color. I am the original owner of this kayak, I bought it new ordered from Appalachian Outfitters about 2 yrs ago. I have all of the original paperwork from when I purchased it. This kayak will come with everything as it would if purchased new plus an additional 1.5"" screwball. There are some scratches on bottom from use and some material loss on bottom back fin (could be regained with plastic welding) if one finds need be. The separator between the seat and back dry well could use to be resealed (common issue).  I purchased this model for around $1,200 when I bought it, so here's a chance to save some money on a great and very comfortable kayak. If one has back issues or plans to be on water for several hours at a time, the seat in this model is the best I've ever come across. The kayak is currently buried behind stuff in the garage and the weather sux so I have not taken any original pictures yet. If someone is truly interested I would make effort to get that done or they could come view in person. *Cash Only Sale!

All the required safety equipment is included too, two or three life jackets, whistle, flag, etc. I also have the owners manual and an extra carburetor kit for the outboard. Lastly, there is a set of oars included. The only bad about the boat is that it has gray paint on it that is flaked off on the inside of the boat. It does not affect the ability of the operator to put fish in the boat! but it could use a good rattle can job. If you're interested, I'm asking 1900 obo.
