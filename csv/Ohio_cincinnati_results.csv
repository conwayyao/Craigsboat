Our plans have changed and the boat is for sale.As I stated the boat is in good condition but still needs some attention. The boat will need canvas the bottom paint finished and a few minor items fixed.I will sell the boat for 8,150 without trailer.I will sell it with trailer for 10,650.The trailer is a 2004 Performance in very good condition.The trailer is probably a little small for the boat if you were going to trailer full time, if you were going to use it twice a year to transport to lake it would do fine.I towed it 300 miles when I purchased it. This is a very roomy boat for being only 28' long.The boat is powered by a single Crusader 454 direct drive inboard.Call with questions.Possible partial trade. Review: Every manufacturer seems to have key luck with some of its selected models. For its part, Carver certainly did well with the 28-foot Riviera during its production run in the 1980s. It is a compact family cruiser whose relatively affordable price and unique two-cabin layout, struck a responsive cord with many boaters. I remember these boats being so popular that it wasn't uncommon to see several of them moored in close proximity to one other. We recently checked out a 1986 model. Built on a solid fiberglass hull, this unique model features an open-air center cockpit. The wraparound windshield offers great visibility and the large side windows offer great cross ventilation. The canvas top can also be easily removed; this can even be one in two separate sections for ultimate versatility. The port side of the cockpit features a cockpit table, which can be converted to a small, yet functional, berth when not in use. A handy movable backrest allows four to sit around the table and reveals a large passenger seat up forward when flipped to the aft position. Just ahead of the passenger seat is a large storage locker that doubles as a dry bar. Below the raised seat, you'll find plenty of additional storage for large items such as fenders and safety gear. Off to starboard, the helm area features a functional dash with plenty of room to flush and surface-mount electronics. The helm seat is quite large and below it you will even find more storage space. The forward cabin of the Riviera is quite spacious and offers ample headroom throughout. The galley to starboard features an alcohol/electric stove, built-in overhead toaster over, under-counter refrigerator, and ample counter and storage space. To port, there is a roomy head compartment, which again offers lots of headroom and a comfortable amount of space. A large U-shaped dinette encompasses the forward part of the main cabin and the high/low table converts this area to a very spacious berth. Additional sleeping accommodation can be found in the aft cabin, which features its own private entrance from the aft area of the cockpit. Here you'll find a single berth to starboard and a double berth to port. Also featured is a large storage locker between the beds, complete with mirrored doors and a vanity sink.",,5901393215,40.535900,28,-85.661600,,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@40.535900,-85.661600,16z",,$8050,power," (Marion,IN)",1985 Carver 2807 Carver Riviera,https://cincinnati.craigslist.org/boa/5901393215.html,
