33,excellent,"['41.449289', '-81.922302']",2016-12-19 12:20,"I have a Seadoo 3 seater. I was about to put it in storage but I have no room. There is nothing wrong with it. It comes with a triton aluminum trailer. Friday will be warm if you want to put it on the water. This is a two stroke motor with the 717 motor. It's ready to go. And remember this........I'm not pressed to sale it.   ATTTENTION: If you area DEALER or LOW BALLER trying to prosper off of me......FORGET IT. Advantages of 2 Stroke Engines: - Two-stroke engines do not have valves, simplifying their construction. - Two-stroke engines fire once every revolution (four-stroke engines fire once every other revolution). This gives two-stroke engines a significant power boost. - Two-stroke engines are lighter, and cost less to manufacture. - Two-stroke engines have the potential for about twice the power in the same size because there are twice as many power strokes per revolution. Disadvantages of 2 Stroke Engines: - Two-stroke engines don't live as long as four-stroke engines. The lack of a dedicated lubrication system means that the parts of a two-stroke engine wear-out faster. Two-stroke engines require a mix of oil in with the gas to lubricate the crankshaft, connecting rod and cylinder walls. - Two-stroke oil can be expensive. Mixing ratio is about 4 ounces per gallon of gas: burning about a gallon of oil every 1,000 miles. - Two-stroke engines do not use fuel efficiently, yielding fewer miles per gallon. - Two-stroke engines produce more pollution. From: -- The combustion of the oil in the gas. The oil makes all two-stroke engines smoky to some extent, and a badly worn two-stroke engine can emit more oily smoke. -- Each time a new mix of air/fuel is loaded into the combustion chamber, part of it leaks out through the exhaust port. Clearing the Air Michael Harrison from the DeepScience BIGENZ team has this to say: Most of what is written on advantages and disadvantages of 2 strokes Vs 4 strokes is not actually correct. Take for example the lubrication issue of 2 stroke engines, sure small chainsaw engines may have the oil mixed with the fuel but this is not a direct result of the engine being a 2 stroke, this is just a result of someone designing a very simple engine. look at any large Caterpillar, or Detroit 2 stroke they have conventional oil sumps, oil pumps and full pressure fed lubrication systems and they are 2 stroke! Also, the argument about valves of 4 strokes versus the reeds and ports of 2 strokes is also incorrect. Sure some simple 2 strokes may use very primative systems to achieve the conrol of fuel/air mixture into the engine and exhaust out of the engine but again this is not a function of them being 2 stroke! I've worked on 2 stroke engines that feature poppet valves in the head (like a standard 4 stroke) - but they are definately 2 stroke - it's just that engines like this are not so much in the public eye - next time an ocean liner (ship) pulls into port check out its 2 stroke, turbo charged, direct injected diesel engine! Finally, the arguments of simplicity, weight, power to weight, and cost of manufacturing are not a function as such of 2 stroke versus 4 stroke engines. The mistake of most of these commentaries is that they are comparing a simple chainsaw 2 stroke engine with a complex 4 stroke engine from a automobile - not a very fair comparision. As far as the exhaust emmisions of 2 strokes - check out the Surrich/Orbital 2 stroke design that Mercury outboards are using - this is as clean burning as any 4 stroke. The ONLY correct comparison of 2 strokes with 4 strokes is that a 2 stroke can (in theory) produce twice the power of a 4 stroke for the same sized engine and the same revs. 2005 SEA-DOO GTI BASE SPECIFICATIONS IDENTIFICATION MODEL TYPE	 3-4 Passenger BASE MSRP(US)	 $6,299.00 DEALERS	 Sea-Doo Dealers WARRANTY	 12 INSURANCE ENGINE: ENGINE TYPE	 In-line CYLINDERS	 2 ENGINE STROKE	 2-Stroke HORSEPOWER RPM	 6750 DISPLACEMENT (CC/CI)	 718 / 43.8 CARBURETION TYPE	 Carburetor STEERING: STEERING ASSIST SYSTEM	 Yes TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: LENGTH (FT)	 10.08 WIDTH (IN/MM)	 47.2 / 1198.9 HEIGHT (IN/MM)	 40.9 / 1038.9 DRY WEIGHT (LBS/KG)	 623 / 282.6 FUEL CAPACITY (GAL/L)	 15 / 56.8 STORAGE CAPACITY (CUFT/GAL/L)	 5.3 / 34.2 / 150.6 SEATS: NUMBER OF SEATS	 3 EXTERIOR: BODY MATERIAL	 Fiberglass Reinforced Composite (FRC) HULL MATERIAL	 Fiberglass Reinforced Composite (FRC) HULL TYPE	 Semi V SPONSONS	 Standard BOARDING STEP	 Standard CONVENIENCE: BILGE SYSTEM TYPE	 Automatic Siphon STORAGE: UNDERSEAT STORAGE	 Standard GLOVE BOX / DASH STORAGE	 Standard FRONT STORAGE WELL	 Standard",,5925515824,41.449289,10,-81.922302,Bombardier,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@41.449289,-81.922302,16z",Seadoo GTI,$3500,power, (Westlake),2005 GTI Seadoo,https://cleveland.craigslist.org/boa/5925515824.html,2005

65,good,,2016-12-17 11:13,"This boat is the Great Lakes fisherman's dream with outstanding front and rear deck access, the power to get from A to B, and the rugged hull design capable of delivering in the most challenging lake conditions. Larson had the ocean in mind when the engineers put this model together. The 1990, International DC-228 is a 22 foot I/O . The dry unlaiden weight of the boat is 2800 lbs She is a beautiful and well constructed boat, that has had a lot of key replacements done to her. She comes on a newer trailer, and has bee re-powered with Chevy Vortec engine that produces 350 HP, and through hull exhaust that purrs nicely and is teamed with the durable top of the line Volvo Dou-Prop out drive that all performs perfectly. She also has new bellows and has had all shift cables recently replaced as well. For trolling, she comes with a Yamaha 9.9 kicker motor with mount. Motor is a Yamaha 4 stroke and is a low hour 2006. She has been used her whole life in the fresh waters of lake Erie however this boat is built for big water... great lakes or ocean.... and she not afraid of big rollers... The max rated horsepower of this boat, as listed by the manufacturer, is 250 hp. However, the Vortec re power and custom thru-hull exhaust have increased this output to 350 Hp. The boat has been meticulously maintained by a life long boater and no expense has been spared in keeping her top notch. You will notice some hull marks, but not to worry, the bot used to be moored and had a very expensive bottom paint on her. It has been kept high and dry the last 7 years and the bottom paint was removed and there are some remnants of that coating. Yacht Highlights: * Perfect Size For Fishing Or Cruising * Larson Major Brand Name * International Walkaround Addition * Vortec I/O 350 HP For more pictures.... just ask.... thanks",,5907120631,,23,,,,,$9900,power, (cleveland),International DC 228,https://cleveland.craigslist.org/boa/5907120631.html,
