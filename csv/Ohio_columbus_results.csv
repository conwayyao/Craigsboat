I took Merc off and added the hard top from another Pro Line I Had and removed the name decals.  I pulled the merc controls and wiring and started to install Yamaha controls and wiring.  I then decided to buy a bigger boat and parked this one to finish this winter.  I have now brought a little speed boat as a winter project so this one is up for sale. The boat appears solid but has not been tested or surveyed and will be sold as is. Selling boat with hardtop and trailer.  NO power, NO controls, NO engine wiring.

It is essentially a fork lift on the water! It is fully functional and ready to go to work!  This is the perfect opportunity to get in the boat lift and dock removal/installation business!  Most companies in the industry charge $150-$250 to put a customer's lift into the water and the same cost to remove the lift in the fall.  This investment can pay itself off quick! With a push of a button, you can raise and lower the hydraulic lift on the barge.  It takes the back-breaking work out of moving boat lifts. There are countless hours of fabrication put into this machine.  Own it for a fraction of what it would cost to buy one new! The boat has a 90 HP Johnson engine that runs great and has recently been serviced.  Everything on the boat works. It also comes with a very nice dual axle bunk trailer.

It has never been put away wet and has always been stored semi-inflated in my basement, which is the recommended method when storing it long term. I've treated it with UV conditioner at the beginning and end of every season. I used it mostly just for recreational paddling and camping, but a fisherman would probably enjoy it more than anyone else because of how amazingly stable it is,  and how it can be configured for fishing (the main pic is a stock photo of an older model Paddleski configured for fishing). You can put a trolling motor or small outboard motor on it, and also a sail or a rowing platform!
