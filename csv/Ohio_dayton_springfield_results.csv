0,good,,2016-12-20 20:40,"1988 24 foot baja. In 1988 they did not include the swim platform as part of the total length. In 1990 this boat became the 240 sport. It has a 454 with around 200 hrs on it and was rebuilt to 425 horse power. It has forged rods and forged flat top pistons and has 9:1 compression ratio and has always ran on 93 octane gasoline. Has a little bigger cam then stock and sounds really good. Has stock heads, aluminum intake. And a 780 demon chokeless carb. The boat runs great with no problems. It will run 70 mph. Has a mirage 25 pitch stainless steel prop.  The boat has thru hall exhaust. The interior of the boat is original except for the front 2 seats. The interior is in great shape for its age. The exterior of the boat is also in great shape. It is an 8 out of 10. The boat has only around 390 hrs total. So this is extremely low. I have owned this boat for almost 9 years. Its a great boat. I just had the empeller changed along with the alignment of the outdrive checked. I have always done this every other year. The boat comes with an Oklahoma tandem axle trailer. The trailer has surge brakes and i just replaced all of the brake components 2 years ago. Last year the master cylinder stuck so the brakes are disconnected right now",200,5927613202,,24,,Baja,,226/240 sport,$12000,power, (franklin oh),1988 Baja 226/240 sport,https://dayton.craigslist.org/boa/5927613202.html,1988

The floor is solid and the carpet is in good shape - it was replaced last year. It has a Mercruiser 3.0 LX 4 cylinder engine with an Alpha One outdrive. The engine is extremely fuel efficient and has plenty power to pull a skier or give a fun ride on a tube. Stainless steel propeller (also have an aluminum prop with a lower pitch - better for hole-shot). All gauges and lights work. All of the switches were replaced with marine labeled Carling switches. New alternator. New gimbal bearing. New impeller. New automatic bilge pump. New depth finder (also reads water and air temperature). Lots of new parts. Bluetooth sound system with four speakers (just connect your phone to the bluetooth and control through your phone - no head unit for unnecessary battery drain). Plenty loud to hear while underway or in a cove. Also has an auxiliary input as well as three USB charger ports built into the glovebox. Comes with a trailer in great shape with new bearings, wheels, tires, and LED lights. I have always kept it stored indoors, but it has a cover for outside storage. I have taken multiple trips to Caesar Creek (at least once a week), Indian Lake, Brookville, Cumberland, and Norris this year and have had no issues with the boat or the trailer.
