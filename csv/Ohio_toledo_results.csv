The boat has been meticulously maintained by a life long boater and no expense has been spared in keeping her top notch.

Most companies in the industry charge $150-$250 to put a customer's lift into the water and the same cost to remove the lift in the fall.  This investment can pay itself off quick! With a push of a button, you can raise and lower the hydraulic lift on the barge.  It takes the back-breaking work out of moving boat lifts. There are countless hours of fabrication put into this machine.  Own it for a fraction of what it would cost to buy one new!

95,good,"['42.428900', '-83.782800']",2016-12-08 09:20,"I have a complete set of pontoon boat seats for sale. They can be reupholstered, or installed and used like they are. They are wood bases, in good solid condition. They are completely dry not wet or soggy from being on a boat deck or stored outdoors. They have been stored indoors out of the weather, for a couple of years. The vinyl is cracked and a few seams are split. But the foam is in good condition, as are the bases. When reupholstering, the new foam can be the most expensive component. These could be recovered like new, for half the price of new. Completely assembled these seats will create an ""L"" shaped arrangement for most pontoon boats. ( See Photo Below) Or split the couches up and place them where you want them, there are many options. The couches with arm rests attached are 55"" long and 30"" tall. The single couch with no arm rests attached is 45"" long and 30"" tall. The corner couches are 33"" x 33"" and 30"" tall. These would be a great winter project! I am asking $75 each, but will consider all offers. I would like to sell the group as a complete set. Make me a reasonable offer. Contact me if you have questions or need additional dimensions.
