They are hard to find near you aren't they?  Especially one that has been well cared for and still feels like a newer boat.  LOOK NO FURTHER!  Upgrades include a foot gas pedal, Minnkota Fortrex 101 lb 36 volt trolling motor in great shape,  two Humminbird 798 units with gps, sidescan and downscan, 6 livewell pumps (2 intake, 2 outtake, 2 recirculate) that have been replaced, upgrades to the fuel system for handling today's ethanol in gas including gas gauge sensor, entire fuel line, 2 new electric fuel pumps and a rebuilt mechanical fuel pump, and a newer 3 bank charger for the trolling motor batteries piggybacked to an on board trickle charger for the cranking motor and accessory battery for single plug-in recharging.  The trolling motor batteries run all day and take a full charge, and the cranking battery was bought new this year.  The trailer has a newer winch and new wire harness, and jack was replaced a handful of years ago.  The motor looks like a newer one and pushes the boat near 70 MPH. What's the down side?   Nothing if you want an incredible machine at a fraction of the cost.  Everything that is needed for practical use has been maintained or replaced on an ongoing basis to keep the boat in top performance.  Items that aren't needed, wanted or used that have been left unreplaced or unrepaired include small light bulbs, the windshield has a crack in it that has been epoxied and works fine, and the electric jack plate's control knob (signal sender at the console to make it go up and down) doesn't work.  The jack plate motor still works and you can raise and lower the engine by bypassing the sending unit at the motor.  Essentially you have a manual jack plate as it is or you can replace the control knob, but I have to tell you it is a waste of time and money.  I always kept the motor in one spot anyway and you can't gain extra noticeable performance in the motor tweaking it's height.  It is overkill.  Lastly the trailer has had 17 years of dunking in and out of lakes and is steel tubing.  I would be lying if I told you it was in great shape, but it is better than most trailers this age.  I can't think of anything else not in new condition.  I have kept all heavy use items in good working order like the two live wells, compartment gas springs, bilges, depth finders, the trolling motor, and of course the big motor.  I am meticulous with maintenance (and other things which you can probably tell from this long winded add, LOL).  I do all required motor and boat maintenance and winterizing and even go above and beyond with things like getting bio-friendly antifreeze in the pumps and drainage compartments for winter and bringing my batteries into the basement.  It has always been garaged.  Why am I selling it?  Because I am an idiot!  Actually I am fine with keeping it, but if I can get my price I will sell it and change things up since I owned this boat for 15 years.  This is a no haggle price so please don't even bother looking at it if you intend on offering a lower price if you see what you expect after looking at this add.  I have done my research and here is what I know.  There isn't much out there close to me for used 21 foot bass boats in good condition.  I am at the high end of the price range and for good reason, but in the range.  I take care of my stuff better than 99% of the people in the world.  If you buy this boat it is my loss and you win!

99,good,"['40.976010', '-81.407146']",2016-11-11 11:13,"I'm selling my 1981 Bass Tracker 14ft aluminum fishing boat. Comes with a Mercury 25HP outboard motor and the trailer. There is nothing wrong with it what-so-ever, I'm only selling it because I bought a newer boat with a bigger outboard. I just had a custom wood floor put in to have a nice surface to walk on and a new starter put in at the beginning of this summer. Motor starts right up and runs with no issues. Just came back from my 2nd fishing trip this season in Quebec, Canada with this boat. Both the boat and the outboard motor come with Ohio titles. The trailer comes with a bill of sale (you just get it weighed for a registration). Come look at it and be the judge yourself, I'm certain you won't be disappointed. If you have any other questions or would like to come look at the boat in person, you are more than welcome to Email or Text/Call show contact info Titles are in hand, notarized, and ready to transfer to the new owner at any time or day.",,5835513833,40.976010,14,-81.407146,Bass Tracker,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@40.976010,-81.407146,16z",,$2000,power," (UNIONTOWN, OH)",1981 Bass Tracker II Aluminum Fishing Boat w/ Trailer & 25HP Mercury,https://youngstown.craigslist.org/boa/5835513833.html,1981
