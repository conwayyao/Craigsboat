I bought a solid boat with very low time hours on Four Stroke Yamaha's 225 and 9.8 kicker that were added in 2002. Both engines are low time and in excellent condition, fully serviced and ready to go. As a very experienced off-shore Tuna, Salmon, Halabut and Crab hunter I knew exactly what to add to this great boat. Here is what I added: Great electronics for navigation, communication and finding fish , Crab Davit for pulling pots off the ocean or River/bay floor with ease, and Scotty Down Riggers for Salmon. Lot's of pole holders for Tuna trolling. Canvas and clears are new and built for the boat. Lot's of storage compartments and aerated fish compartment. Wash down system with new pump, dual batteries, cut off switch and wind shield wiper. All work professionally done by Denis Boat Shop, Britton Boat Repair and Monty Sells Apolstery, all located in Salem. The engines alone are worth more than I am asking. Trailer has new bunks and carpet. It is in excellent condition. This could easily double as a lake ski boat. The 225 will propel it to 38 mph on flat water. So much more to this boat. A must see before you buy. Everything I added is new and high quality.  All you have to do is go fishing.
