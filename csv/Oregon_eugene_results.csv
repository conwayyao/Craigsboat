Alden Kingsbury learned the art of canoe building in the Charles River area of Massachusetts.  In 1908 he started building canoes with the Charles River style decks and thwarts, on the shore of Lake Sammamish.  The town of Monohon was a lumber town and Kingsbury made use of available lumber of red cedar for planking and Douglas fir for decks, seats and trim.  In 1913 Kingsbury returned to the East coast and built canoes under the name of Kingsbury Canoes with details similar to the Monohon canoes. This canoe was rebuilt with new canvas, new caned seats and trim of Douglas fir.

Needs a depth sounder, this one partially works + an antenna for an older model gps, that you may want to replace if want to add more bells + whistles. their is also a small hand help gps. as far as other electronics like radar, chart plotters, you may want to choose for your self, for we do not use them. sails are in good shape, main a little stretched but good + 2nd stay sail fairly new, used a few times. mast is aluminum; If want it more traditional you could restore to original wood mast, 7 ft shorter (now reaches nice in light wind being taller) + then would have to get new rigging + sails to fit. aluminum mast being taller is great for light winds + heavier winds you reef. Windows are dull + could be replaced. if want to cherry out boat for your liking, it will be a great boat. the boat is well worth your effort to make it yours. House over entrance could be redone with board similar to hull if wanted to retain tradition. we did with plywood, epoxy + paint. nice for wind + sun. Simple design but choice of wood is nice with traditional shape. wood is from locally grown woods found in central to southern coast of Oregon. built in Coos Bay, Or. launched in 1988. wood includes port orford cedar mostly, Douglas fir, pacific yew, yellow cedar, white oak. topsides decking are cotton caulked. Decking laid Douglas fir old growth with galvanized steel wood screw fastenings. ceiling 1/2"" thick yellow cedar fastened down with steel nails. concrete keel encased in case hardened steel with 1"" diameter galvanized steel bolts. Tractor tread steel pins inside extended seats, to have more weight for volume. equal 1 1/2 ton of pig iron lead ingots. more weight was added to provide more stability for the aluminum mast which is 7 taller then the original wooden mast. herringbone chime construction. Original owner was a forest worker in Oregon selected each board. built it for 10 years died right before finished 1988. 56"" head room in cabin, v birth has nice raised hatch, with wood vents or clear plastic. as well back entry hatch. does not have a head.

Only major negative of this boat is the location of the 30 gallon diesel stainless tank, which would be a major job to get it out, if needed. when our fuel lines got clogged we think due to bio-cide breaking up pieces or perhaps Mexican fuel big seas churning the fuel. we resolved by putting a line to cockpit to switch if be in similar condition + unable to easily empty out tank. We do have 2 filters + now can also have option to go directly into a 5 gallon jug of clean fuel in cockpit. which is great back up. we carry external jugs of fuel also. 12 + 19 gallon water tank, simple piping for faucet with foot switch manual pump.
