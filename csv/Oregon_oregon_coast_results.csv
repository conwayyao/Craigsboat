The Cats Paw sailing Dinghy is the interpretation of Maine boatbuilder and designer Joel White, and is inspired by Herreshoffs classic Columbia Dinghy. Constructed to the highest standards. Careful attention to detail and use of quality materials ad to the pleasure of owning her. The simple elegance of the hull form and beautiful lines will make even the most discerning yachtsmen take notice. The Catspaw is easily managed by one person. She is great for a daysail or row and will be happy living at the dock or on a trailer in your garage. And, she is surprisingly seaworthy for such a small boat. This boat has light whitetopsides with a blue sheer. The inboard finish is a combination of varnished rails,  knees and Deks Olja matte for a rich transparent  finish that won't build up Custom sprit sails and a pair of leathered oars are included.

It was built by the famous boat builder- Lex Fromm and to make it more unique it was one of the last boats he built and it was for his nephew. I have all the paperwork. It has always been stored undercover and you must see to appreciate.  This is a wooden boat. Serious callers only. Too many extras too list but has a very good 8hp Yamaha kicker and top. The main engine is a very solid 351 dodge and has low hours on it.  This price is only good until Dec. 24th.
