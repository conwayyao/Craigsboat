Redid all the fuel lines. Rebuilt the stock 550 with high comp Pistons put a mikuni SBN44 carb on it and had it jetted to motor and high performance exhaust pipe. Put a light weight water box on it and put in a 4.5 gallon gas tank so u can ride all day. This is also a custom model it has a 440 driveshaft and pump combo which increases acceleration since its lighter and spins quicker have also thrown a more out the gate skat track impeller on it. And a new bilge pump and mounting bracket for said bilge pump. Inline fuel filter (clear)Hmmm... What else. All new electrical box components. Including CDI and plug boots. Custom throttle lever. Quick adjust carb knobs ah and good tags through 2016 So now for the cons. It needs a new battery and start stop switch. I have one you can have the if you buy the ski, and to be tuned. I have however had it running since I did all this work for an hour or two to get the bottom end tuned but I got sidetracked and left the battery in it for a week so now it doesn't work anymore. The carb has finger adjustments though so it makes tuning a snap. Jumped my boat battery to it and it started up running rich in idle. Everything is flawless on this ski. New paint new hydro turf. New grips new quik turn. Needs new start stop have lanyard, new throttle cable. New motor mounts. New battery and starter cables. Newly balanced flywheel.

The engine has good compression, (right side front to back, 110, 110, 120, - left side front to back 120, 110, 110).  All controls are still on the boat and have seats (need new wood). I have the floor out ready to sand the fiberglass and put in a new one.  I also have all the seats, but did not plan on reusing them.  The trailer is in good shape, but has no title.  I do have the California license plate to help get a letter from California to get an Oregon Title. The boat was last registered in California and I have the paperwork to take to Oregon Marine Board to have an Oregon title issued. I am open to all offers, asking $600/OBO/Trade.  The GM/Buick 90 degree V6 was the engine sold to Jeep and used by them for several years. I would consider parting out the boat.
