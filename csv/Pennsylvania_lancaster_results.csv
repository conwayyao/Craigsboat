A boat that was used on a regular basis or one being sold due to a lack of use? Most boats are being sold because they are no longer being used enough to keep them. We are selling ours to buy a deck boat. Our boat never had a chance to build up condensation or corrosion in the engine or drive train. It was thoroughly cleaned, fluid levels checked and properly lubricated every time it was used. We are the second owners, we have it for a year. It spent it's entire life prior on the fresh water Lake Wallenpaupack in the Poconos in Pa. It never had it's own trailer, so we bought a new one for it. Serious buyer with cash? We can take it to the river and you can test drive it.

The mid-cabin (usually reserved for children or storage), is large enough to be the master stateroom. Bathed in natural light from forward and side, the interior of the 3060 compares in size and amenities to many larger cruisers. A comfortable dining area converts quickly to large queen-size sleeping quarters. A full galley includes a microwave oven, double burner stove, and ample refrigeration. The 3060 has Regal's innovative Cockpit Forward Seating arrangement. The main seating group is located adjacent to the helm, not in the rear. Everyone rides up front with the captain and shares the helm station view. The helm seat swivels to face the group for better socializing and, with a simple adjustment, the cockpit table slides into ideal position between group and helm. Cockpit table is removable.
