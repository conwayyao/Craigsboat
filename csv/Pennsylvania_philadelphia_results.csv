The boat has a newer 20 Gallon aluminum fuel tank, 1 year since replaced Transom, Floor, and stringers.  Comes with an extra alfa 1 outdrive, carburetor and miscellaneous parts.  The boat came with a 2 axle load rite trailer with the old style trailer brake and rollers, the brake line did brake but easy to replace.  I was given a title to the boat but not the trailer.  I am selling them together and have the service manual for the boat as well.  This is a great boat to replace the engine or if someone knows how to repair.  The parts alone plus the trailer are worth more then i am asking.

Built in paddleholders are on both sides. Extras added include a Yak Attack anchor trolley, 5 RAM balls for adding rodholders, depthfinder and GoPro camera (camera not included). Rodholders included. I've installed a Jackson standing bar that works perfectly if you want to stand. Stand assist strap comes standard to help you get up and down. Beautiful sunrise color. Bought in April this year, last in store, never used. Only used about 6 times. The second kayak is a Necky Vector 14, extras I've added include 2 RAM balls up front for adding depthfinder and GoPro, Scotty rodholder, larger RAM ball in rear and 2 more Scotty rodholders in rear as well. Again, all rodholders are included which will fit all mounts. Paddleholder added. The color is yellow and I bought last year as a leftover (not used) again in April. Paddled about 10 times. This kayak is built for touring and is fast, will get you there efficiently. Also included is a Humminbird 176i depthfinder GPS, transducers are mounted in both hulls to shoot through and work good. I've figured the price at new with all the addons as about twice as much as I'm asking. The kayaks are in excellent condition and I'm selling because I'm adding a boat and have another sit on top. Price is firm and I'm selling as a pair only, will be glad to keep if they don't sell. Don't confuse these kayaks with cheap knockoffs or cheaper yaks.

I recently bought a piece of property that has a Bertram 25' boat sitting on it. The boat has been sitting for nearly 20 years and will probably need a complete restoration. I know almost nothing about this boat, so please do not respond with questions about its functionality. One of the two engines has been removed and was in the process of being rebuilt when it was left by the former owner. I have what I believe to be all the parts of the removed engine and will include them with the boat. Over all it seems to be complete. The boat does not have a trailer, so you will need to furnish one in order to move it. I am offering this boat ""as is, where is"" and I will need for you to sign a waiver freeing me from any liability resulting from its removal. From what I have read this boat has got a passionate group of followers, so I am hoping that someone will bring it back into its glory. Please hit the reply button above and use the email address provided to contact me. I can show the boat just about any time during the day light hours. Due to all of the ""no shows"" I have had, I am now offering this boat strictly on a ""first come, first served"" basis. The first person who shows up with a trailer capable of transporting this boat gets it. I will not schedule any showings or pick up in advance and I will not hold this boat for anyone. Once you contact me via email, I will give you my number and you can call me when you are prepared to get in your car and drive straight to Collegeville Pa 19426.

89,excellent,,2016-12-16 14:45,"FOR SALE: Newly restored Barnegat Bay duck boat/ sneak box.  Approximately 12ft in length and comes with a trailer.  Picked the boat up a few years ago in rough shape but was still able to use it.  Have killed many ducks and geese from this very boat.  Now that I am in college I have no time to hunt so I decided to fix the boat up and sell it.  The boat has brand new paint and a brand new floor.  The oar locks are new as well and made of cedar so they will not rot.  The paint is a special marine grade paint. There are two coats on the boat as well as marine grade primer.  The boat includes: two oars, an anchor, camo cloth, drain plug and one soft bumper.  Right now I do not have the motor mount on the boat, but I did make and paint one so all you have to do is bolt it onto the back and you can mount a motor.  The restoration I did on the boat included removing all of the rotten wood and replacing it and removing the water logged foam from the back of the boat. The trailer it sits on is sound but does need a wire or two to be soldered.
