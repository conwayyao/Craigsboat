A 17' Queen Charlotte: the first of all Pygmy's models. -It is used but in very good condition. Pygmy kayaks are only offered as kits and yet the boats when completed are among the best you can buy. -This one is newly recoated with the same West System Epoxy as is used to build it, and also partially finished with Z-Spar Flagship UV resistant marine varnish, always the final step after new epoxy. -A skeg has been added to this most maneuverable of Pygmy models to increase straight-line tracking for touring purposes. It would be very easy to remove or modify it, for maximum playfulness in surf. -This is a kayak with a very spacious entrance and interior. There are no storage hatches (Pygmy sells kits to add them if desired) or bulkheads (one thing this means is, if you are flexible enough, you can actually lay flat and sleep in the boat...). Very beautifully & intelligently styled, completely solid and leak free, and very tough and durable. This is a hard-chined boat with very flat deck for immunity to high winds. Most amazing however, is this 17 footer weighs in at about 37 pounds: the only other place to find this type lightness is with a kevlar boat costing several thousand dollars or more. ALSO INCLUDED: 1. Two full size flotation bags for emergency buoyancy if desired, to compensate for the lack of bulkheads. 2. The remainder of the new quart of Z-spar Flagship varnish bought specifically for this boat. After the new coat of epoxy some of it was applied to the deck for UV protection. I believe enough remains to easily give the entire hull a second coat, desirable in the long run. Overall condition excellent with some evidence of use and normal signs of kit boat construction.

All of the exterior upholstery has been replaced in 2014 as well as a complete engine rebuild in 2012. Since then, we have only put 12 hours on the engine. It has a Merc 260 hp engine and runs really strong. The engine is currently winterized. Interior is in fantastic shape, and spacious. It sleeps 6 people. There is two bedrooms along with a kitchen area, shower/bathroom. It has hookups for a hot water tank, refrigerator, sinks, stove and plenty more. Trailer is included. Items that will need attention. Trailer lights work intermittently and the trailer brakes will need to be serviced. Also, the battery for the boat is getting weak, I would suggest replacing for the new season. I have all the paperwork ready for transfer. If you have any questions, please let me know. Asking $8,500 or best offer will consider trades!

All vehicles will be cleaned before undercoating is applied. The undercoating that is being used is more of an oil based product. Shoots clean and sticks to all metal surfaces. The salt that the state uses now is a liquid based product that finds ways to get inside of the little corners and pockets of the underneath of your car that you can't see.
