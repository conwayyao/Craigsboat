I will consider selling just the boat and trailer without the motor for $5,200.00 if you've got your own power. Boat is rated for up to 175 HP. The boat: 2000 Nitro by Tracker. Very well kept. All new seats. (plus 2 used spare seats. One with back and no post. One with no back and a tall post) Loads of storage compartments. New Humminbird 197c fishfinder at console and factory Tracker Pro 128 at the bow. Motor Guide Tracker 60, 12/24 volt trolling motor. On board 2 bank battery charger. Two bilge pumps. One factory and one new automatic.  Two live well pumps. One is new.  Detailed wiring. Three location trim controls. New dual steering cables. Well accented dash with water temp, fuel, volts, trim, water pressure, tack, speedo,  40 gallon gas tank and large oil tank for oil injection. Good on gas too. Current registration and clear title for boat. The motor: Mercury XR6 150 HP. Stainless steel prop. Recent maintenance included new plugs, impeller and lower unit lube. Starts easy and runs smooth. The Trailer: Two new wheels and tires. (700 miles) Two spares. Surge disc brakes. New breakaway safety cable. Bearing buddies with covers. Swing away tongue. Detailed wiring. New heavy duty transom saver.  ""UPDATE"" - Clear title now in my name.
