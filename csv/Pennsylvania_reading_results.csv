Those include but not limited to oars, fenders, ropes, compass, level, tiller tamer, air horn, life ring, anchors, bag and container for storing sails, tarps, bungies and ties, original owners manual, etc. The reason I decided to sell is because after two years of owning the boat, I haven't been able to find the time I was hoping to to learn how to sail on it. I did successfully learn and this thing is a breeze to operate. The trailer and boat both have clean titles. The trailer has brand new tires and two old spares. The wiring on the trailer works 90% of the time, but once or twice I did have a turn signal go out then come back. May just need a new 4 way connector, not sure.

33,excellent,[],2016-12-04 19:20,"Necky Looksha Sport LV (low volume) sea kayak - (almost) ONE OF A KIND!!! 14' long, 22"" wide. ONLY 30 lbs. Clear Coat over ""natural"" Carbon Kevlar Fabric hull and deck. This boat has been dubbed the ""Stealth Kayak"" as the color blends into the water color and the clean deck is free from lines and such. Sized for a medium adult. If you want/need/deserve a unique boat, here you go.  Great all around sea kayak and you can paddle anywhere with confidence: river, lake, ocean, inlet, surf, etc. A day trip boat that you'll be glad to have in your quiver. The incredible light weight means that it is easy to heft up on top of the SUV plus it is fast & maneuverable. I bought it new from Schuylkill Outfitters at North Wildwood, NJ (now out of business) about about 8 years ago.  He had it listed at $3,200 because of the Carbon Kevlar construction and light weight. He told me that this was one of only 15 boats of this model made of Kevlar and it was built by kayaking fanatics in Seattle, Washington who work at the Boeing plant making carbon kevlar parts for the Black Hawk helicopter for the military.  They liked the design so much that they obtained the mold from Necky and produced 15 of these ultra light weight boats. I bought it to paddle out the inlets and surf offshore waves near Cape May & Stone Harbor, North Wildwood at  Hereford, Corson and Townsend Inlets. In very good shape; it has been used a bit but has hardly any scuffs or scratches on the bottom. Adjustable foot braces. All the fittings are there if you wanted to add a rudder kit (sorry no drop skeg)....but if you have some skills, you won't need either as it is so maneuverable. Treat yourself, you deserve it.  You'll never see another one like this on the East Coast; it is a head turner. See the reviews for the design (plastic version): http://www.paddling.net/Reviews/showReviews.html?prod=222 Please reply to posting and include your phone number.

82,,,2016-11-14 13:31,"95 ZXI 2 seater. Ski is nice shape overall, will do about 50mph. Past year I replaced exhaust manifold and expansion pipe , re-gasketed the top end and did new plugs. It comes with a 2009 LoadRite trailer but no title to trailer. You could go to PennDot and deal with getting a new title if you want. Ski does have a Pa title. Can hear it start and run in person,  I have a bin of spare parts to go with ski and a nice fitted cover to go with also. We bought a boat and use that more so the ski doesn't get enough use to justify keeping. The boat launching permit is good till 2018 and I will leave it on there. This ski is plenty quick and cheap to maintain compared to newer 10K+ skis. This still has the oil injection system so you do not need to premix fuel.
