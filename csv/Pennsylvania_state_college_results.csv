3,like new,,2016-12-18 19:02,"**STOP**Please include HURRICANE SUNDECK in the subject and a valid phone number in the message if inquiring. I will disregard any/all inquiries that don't contain both to keep phishing/scamming attempts to a minimum. Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation.**** Bought as new in July 2016: Titles are clean and in hand for all items 16.9hrs. on a 2014 Hurricane Sundeck Sport 188 (Beam is 18'10"") with 2014 Yamaha 115HP/4-stroke OB (Yamaha factory coverage on outboard that IS TRANSFERRABLE is good until August 3, 2019.  Have paperwork and registration card to prove it). I could tell you how great the condition is but I'll let the photos do that. A Hurricane is well known as the SUV of boats... I took that a bit further. What I'll do is share the upgrades that will set this apart. Additions are: -Second Bimini for full length shade coverage which is awesome for fishing as you don't get hammered by the sun. (can cruise at ~15MPH with both bimini's fully deployed very little stress on fabric... could go faster but I think it might stress the fabric and stitching too much or you might take off from the water) -Two covers... the playpen, which came with it and a custom cover that covers the entire deck front-back to include the outboard. Both are trailerable but I usually used the playpen when transporting. -Fully carpeted -2 bow mounted fishing seats that are well placed and are well shaded by the bimini -Minn Kota Powerdrive V2/55lb. thrust that effortlessly pulls the boat to the point of actually creating more of a wake than the outboard with the outboard throttle in the no wake position. It has foot controls AND the wireless Minn Kota Co-pilot system. I can't accurately explain or over emphasize how fantastic this is. It allows you to not need to hook up the foot controls (you still can), but it allows you to wirelessly move the boat about from anywhere onboard without tangles or routing the control wire. HERE's the biggie... You can singlehandedly both launch and trailer it by using this system... let me explain. You launch the boat, keeping the wireless fob with you... using the troller you move the boat out ~30' and have it do slow or faster circles (depending on wind), go park your vehicle/trailer and walk out to the dock and call it in using the wireless fob, step aboard and away you go. It has baffled folks when I've done it. I actually had folks say your boat's adrift... one nice fellow actually was swimming out to it when I returned from parking as he saw there was nobody aboard and tried to help. He saw it start to come to the dock and stopped dead... treaded water with this confused, what the heck is going on look on his face. I thanked and apologized to him and then explained. A few weeks later I saw him again as he's a regular, this time he had a different trolling setup that included the Co-pilot. -SE Sport Hydrofoil with the no drilling into the cavitation plate SE Sport attachment clip. First let me say I've heard that some have had problems with the SE Sport attachment clip falling off, taking the hydrofoil with it. I have no idea what these folks are doing or know if they should be installing it as this boat with just me in it will do 40-45MPH and haven't had a single problem. Most of the time we cruised at ~25-30MPH and, again it stays and remains rock solid. Second, the Hydrofoil decreased the plane time by about 1/2... 1/3 when towing the included Airhead Viper 3 towable and the rear bimini fully deployed. -As mentioned in the last part above there's an Airhead Viper 3 towable (see photo) with a quick connect and 12v inflator/deflator. Never used the deflate portion as opening the valves deflates rapidly. -Hummingbird Depth/Fish Finder w/color display (water temperature sensor) -2 Anchors... 1/20lb. and 1/12lb. with 50' of anchor rope for each. -50' throw rope bag -4 USCG approved PFD's -1 USCG approved throw cushion (also nice for floating around on) -1 Fire extinguisher -Extra propeller The trailer is Heavy Duty, rated for 5000lb., has surge brakes and a detachable/hinged tongue. Honestly, I could go on and on about it, storage, sink, sound system, tilt steering, but I'll stop to keep you from being bored. It has been completely winterized by me using all OEM products and Yamalube everything (I do it myself to ensure it gets done 100% correctly and at a fraction of the cost. All filters were changed, fogged it, treated the fuel... stored with the recommended 3/4 full tank to prevent condensation (36 gallon tank), changed engine oil/filter, lower gearcase oil, removed the new batteries/storing inside, fully charged them and will occasionally trickle charge them. The motor was flushed for 30 minutes using the OB flushing port and flushing muffs... 15 minutes each way. If you're seriously interested get in touch with me and I'd be happy to share more.
