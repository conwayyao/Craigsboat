This Sea Ray is in excellent original condition with only 488 hours showing on the meter. This boat starts easily and handles properly. There are other 260 Sundancers listed that may have more goodies and gadgets. And certainly higher priced models. But it may be difficult to find a cleaner more well kept boat than this one. The hull has no damage and has a nice shine with very few minor scratches from typical use. The interior of this boat is outstanding. There are no stains or soiling to the fabric and the carpet is like new with vinyl carpet protectors throughout. The cockpit features a stern mounted bench seat that folds down for more area, a small removable table with (4) drink holders, a rear facing seat that converts to a lounge and a forward side facing bench seat. There is a single swivel captains seat with stand up or sit to drive positions as well as a tilt steering system. There is a small cockpit sink with pull out shower on the starboard side. The cockpit carpet is also excellent and the vinyl seats are very good with only minor cracking to the aft seat as seen in the photo. The bimini top is new ""toast"" (tan) colored Sunbrella. There is no damage to the bottom of this Sea Ray and the bottom paint is fresh. Other than perhaps an electronics package based on where you intend to cruise this boat, this Sea Ray is ready to drop in the water and enjoy.

Boat interior needs to be thoroughly cleaned, but in great structural condition condition!  (there are mildew spots ALL over the upholstery, elbow grease will be needed!) NOT currently running, that's why it would be a great winter project! 210 horsepower stock. It's also shallow, not as deep as a traditional Bayliner so it can run well in the Susquehanna River, or would be great in a lake!  Never been in salt water. Title in hand! NADA average value (in good, clean shape) is $5,500! (see website http://www.nadaguides.com/Boats/1997/Bayliner-Marine-Corp/2050-SS-BR-CZ__/10018064/Values) The bad :: the crank needs turned.  It is apart right now, we can put it back together or leave it apart so it's easier to get to crank.  Runs and drives, but the 4th bearing spun and should really have crank turned so that it will run well for another 10 years. Outdrive in good shape, prop included Just ready to unload some toys that we have lost interest in...  This has been sitting now for two years because we bought jet skis and a pontoon and haven't had time to deal with it.

Also included is a 50 lb thrust Minn Kota tiller trolling motor and 2 deep cell batteries that are less than 2 years old. We bought the boat about 4 years ago and fully reconditioned it. We raised the floor to offer a larger, higher platform which allowed for under floor storage. The boat has an operable live well and bilge pump. The boat has been completely rewired and equipped with LED lighting. The boat is watertight - taking on a very minimal amount of water after many hours of use. Not even enough for the bilge pump to expel. We purchased the motor new from Bass Pro Shops last Summer, and it has only been used about 6 times. The break-in procedure was followed. Only 93 octane gas been used as well as Sea Foam fuel additive. Motor starts very easy - usually on the first pull. We've decided to sell for we've become involved with horses and other projects, and simply don't have the time to use it any more. I'd like to see it used and appreciated rather than sitting. It really is a great boat! Compact yet spacious enough for 3 adults to fish comfortably. Small and very manuverable, and doesn't track too deep, allowing for access in shallow waters. Boat is light weight and can easy be towed by a small SUV. I had pulled it with a '99 Explorer with the 4.0 V6 and it was like it wasn't even there. Asking $4500. More info available upon request.
