This super clean 1996 40' Mainship Sedan bridge is powered by twin bullet proof fresh water cooled 454 Electronic Fuel Injected Marine Powered engines with 900 hrs (if you know engines, then you know these were extensively over built).  They have two oil filters on each engine which makes sense given the old oil still seems clean when it's changed.   -- Both engines operate perfectly, and have never given me any problems- they start on a dime every time!  Boat also has a built-in Kohler 7,500 KW Generator, runs but needs a capacitor (will be having this fixed over the winter)- meaning it starts and runs but does not put out electricity  Let's start from the top.  2016 season, brand new glass enclosure, the top is in fine shape (about 3 years old).  The flybridge has a wet bar and salon seating paired with a captain's bench seat that adjusts forwards and backwards and co- pilot seat for an addition three people.  There is a ramp that swings up and down allowing a straight walk out to the bow (very unique and extremely useful).  The bow has a bench seat built in and a cradle and davit (not in the pictures because it was removed- can be put back on with ease, it just slides back into place).  The davit has a brand new never used winch motor.  The previous owner had a hard bottom inflatable with a steering wheel mounted on the bow.   Has remote spot light and windlass system. Electronics: Comes with brand new Lowrance Elite 7Chirp Chart Plotter/ Fish Finder mounted flush with the dash as well as a backup smaller color Lowrance GPS.  In addition, it has another Hummingbird Depth/Fish Finder and 25mile Furuno Radar- all operational.   The bridge is wired with two 550 Watt Marine Speakers (mounted on the arch) as well as two additional speakers in the bridge itself.  The sound is unparoled whether you're anchored or underway.  (all upholstery on the bridge is in excellent condition and was replaced about three years ago). The massively spacious cockpit with almost a 14'beam has two side seats with cushions as well as two bench seats facing aft on the swim platform.  There is also a fresh water wash down under one of the stern seats on the platform.  Integrated built in swim ladder and three underwater blue LED's. As you walk into the cabin through the sliding tinted glass door you step down three steps into another unique layout.  With two zone climate controlled AC/Heat both 16,000 BTU's (main cabin replaced two years ago) you will be at what ever temperature you comfortably set it at.  To the port you have a wraparound dinette with seating for 6-7 people.  Then to the starboard an L Shaped salon which converts to a bed and a TV hooked into the digital antenna on the arch.    Next to port is a massive galley with half fridge and freezer combo (replaced four years ago new), built in matching microwave (replaced 4 years ago) deep sink and two burner electric stove (all in perfect operation). As you move forward from the main cabin you step down just one more step to the forward cabin with a bunk room to port, massive master stateroom forward, with a private entry to one of the largest heads a 40-footer can produce.  You can fit three in the shower (don't ask).   But it does have a separate stall for the shower and toilet. Toilet is electric flush into a holding tank that gives you the option of macerating it over board or shore pump out.   In addition to the 12-gallon hot water heater there is also reverse cycled water through the engines so the water is always hot while underway or for about 24 hours after you shut it down. All running gear and hull are in excellent condition with zero damage.  This boat starts on a dime every time and will take you anywhere you want to go.  I have been meticulous about maintenance changing the fluids twice a season.  This boat goes places; it does not sit at the dock so I am confident the next owner will have years of fun left with it. My passion for fishing has me on the lookout for a classic sport fish.  Come and bring your surveyor!
