Modifications to the hull of the original Arlberg design transformed the Typhoon into the Hurricane, a keel/centerboarder with a lower freeboard and draft. The cockpit is open and a gaff rig replaces the original Marconi main and jib. Rigging updated in 2016 to match the Wianno Senior. The deck is cored with Divinycell, and the overlapping hull to deck joint glued with a semi-permanent polysulfide adhesive. The floors and bulkheads are made from a composite material cut to the exact hull shape by a CNC router, then tabbed in place to the hull and deck resulting in a stiffer hull. The Hurricane's open cockpit is roomy; six or more adults can feel comfortable and secure, nestled in the seats. The coaming is set high enough to keep the skipper and crew safe and dry. There's ample storage under the foredeck, in the anchor locker, and the aft bridge deck. Easy to own, launch and sail! Stored in garage since 2005 only sailed one season.
