We took a completely different tact when it comes to bow design, windshield contour, cockpit width and transom styling. The pay off is a breakaway 196 that strikes a decisive balance between gutsy performance, innovative engineering and well thought out features. Clearly, no other sub-20-foot bow rider has as much storage space, legroom or a 9-passenger capacity plate. Inside, the interior screams, ""Get in, and let's find some open water."" Where the fiberglass meets the water, our fine-tuned Extended V-Plane bottom design is enhanced with Kevlar reinforcement for a silky smooth ride.

I stop frequently to inspect the shipment, check tires, grease bearings. I am a boat owner myself for 14 years and will treat your boat as if it was my own. I travel with a smartphone, laptop and GPS so I can be contacted if there are any emergencies or changes in plans any time day or night. Included is up to $100,000 of cargo insurance to cover your boat or vehicle. Please email with shipping information to and from and what needs to be moved for a quote.
