Using a tough multi-core steel flexible shaft, a short tail is half the length of a conventional longtail engine, and the prop is perfectly aligned at 90 degrees to the boat, giving more thrust and keeping the boat in perfect trim. The performance of this Short Tail is amazing. We use Lifan engines, three year warranty on the engine, one year on the short tail. Short-tails use a tough multi-core flexible inner shaft so the prop shaft is curved, presenting the propeller at the correct angle and reducing the overall length considerably. The shaft on this unit is only 48"" long, half the length of the Longtail design. The curve in the short-tail also allows the engine to sit lower in the boat, making the center of gravity lower and the boat more stable. Call Mike for the best deal on a Outboard Engine.

This boat is equipped with a 24V 68# thrust Minn Kota trolling motor, 20-gallon built-in gas tank with in-dash gauge. All decks and transom on LOWE boats are aluminum, there is no wood to rot. Boat runs great, I just don't use it enough to keep it. The only thing it needs is updated electronics to fit your fishing style. I have a few rod holders that are included that can be installed where ever you like.",,5920090879,,17,,Lowe stinger,,,$7000,power, (prosperity sc),2007 Lowe Stinger,https://columbia.craigslist.org/boa/5920090879.html,2007
