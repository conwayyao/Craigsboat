All old paint was stripped away from the outside of the canoe and 3 layers of fiberglass fabric was applied to the outside of it. Due to old age it started to crack on the sides at the bottom but all cracks were stripped of paint and any damaged material and reinforced with 5 layers of fiberglass (shown on pictures). Canoe can use an inside paint job to make it look like new again, but since it was intended for fishing I never got to painting it. Due to lack of time have no use of it now and hate watching it sit without touching a lake. Painted with marine grade paint, scratch resistant paint so should last long time. Has aluminum side railing that are much stronger than modern plastic ones, so you can attach anything to it and do not worry that it will crack the railing. Has a 4 person rating or 800 lbs of gear capacity. Light weight for the size it is, I can lift it myself and load on the roof of my Jeep. Come and check it out for yourself and please take it to the lake and make a good use of it. Canoe is water ready and waiting to go fishing. Text is the best way to reach me.
