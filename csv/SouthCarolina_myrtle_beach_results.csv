The floor was soft, so I decided to refinish the floor....I demo'ed down to the hull. The trailer is a Ez-Loader roller trailer and it is in good shape to be 34 years old! I redid all the lights on the trailer to LED's and they all work. The boat is in need of repairs. My wife became tired of having it in the yard, so it's time to sell. I removed the outdrive and I have already rebuilt it. Just this part alone on eBay is running anywhere from $750-$1200. The engine will need to be rebuilt; I started this process and have all the parts I removed in my garage. I started repainting the parts and they too, are in my garage. Clear title for all three, the boat, motor and trailer....although in SC, you don't register the trailer. The decals are good until 2018. The engine a Volvo Penta AQ125A 4-cylinder. The out drive is a Volvo 270. These engine run like a champ if you take care of them. This will be a great boat if someone wants to put in the time for the refurb. I am willing to part out the engine for parts and sell the trailer....I won't take the boat off the trailer, so that will go with the trailer.
