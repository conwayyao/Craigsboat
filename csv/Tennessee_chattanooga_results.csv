If you have ever spray painted something then you know spray paint just does not last. Powder coat is a more expensive process but is much more resistant to rust. It also keeps your trailer looking new for years to come. *One piece out side frames made from 4 inch box steel. Our trailers are unique in this manufacturing process. Most trailers use several welded pieces to achieve their shape. Ours are cut to length, then shaped creating a much stronger, cleaner looking trailer. The trailer listed here has a ""weight carrying capacity of 6,440 lbs. *3 front stairs leading to a platform with a curved hand rail for safety. *9 lights with LED lights in the fenders. Lights make an object much more visible than reflective tape. *New, 13 inch, 6 ply trailer tires. *Acculube brand hubs featuring rubber unbreakable caps. *1500lb tongue jack. *Rear heavy duty welded tie down eyelets. *Wide frame. This insures that no matter how wide your pontoon boat is, it will ride in the middle of the trailer for a much safer ride. Our wider frame also greatly reduces the risk of roll over while towing. *Written one year warranty. This gives our customers piece of mind in the purchase of their trailer. *Fully adjustable bunks, and stairs. We will even adjust the trailer to your boats specs to take the headache out of sizing. Compare our trailers and see why we earn such high praises from our customers. We would appreciate the opportunity to earn your business as well. If there are any questions we could answer for you please let us know.

1,like new,,2016-12-20 19:03,"I purchased both of these kayaks from Dick's in June (paid $510 for both) and got the out on the Tennessee river before my daughter and I were involved in a head-on collision in August.  I have not been permitted to go out again, and probably won't for another year, which by that time we'll be away from water when we move.  I can't bear to look at them anymore knowing I can't use them, so I'd rather them go to someone that will have as great a time as we did with them.  We were able to fish, relax, and just have fun! These are kept in our living room when we're not using them, and they'll be wiped down before you get them.  They have cushioned seats, holes to drain, and compartments to store your items.  Both kayaks have adjustable foot pedals to rest your feet. The kayak will come with a set of double-ended paddles, each paddle cost $50. I am asking $150 for each or $300 for both....that includes the paddle for each.  One paddle is neon yellow and the other is neon orange.  The measurements are still on the paddles. The fuscia one is a Fusion 124 10'4"" kayak and here is the link with the specs (COPY AND PASTE) http://futurebeach.com/fusion-124.html The blue one is a Pelican Trailblazer 100 and here is the link with the specs also (COPY AND PASTE) http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=31230566&camp=CSE:GooglePLA:31230566:23039648-DSG:PADDLE-SPORTS_KAYAKING_KAYAKS&gclid=Cj0KEQiAyuPCBRCimuayhb3qqvwBEiQAgz62kXRPF-QC_ygdfUbjWy4sLxmz0sva4LRqB2iUiPsZ0uwaAsB28P8HAQ Serious inquiries only please, there are a few scratches on the bottom where we went along rocks in the river, but the material of these kayaks is absolutely amazing!!

I had the carburetor rebuilt last year and also upgraded the points distributor to a new electronic system with all new parts including the distributor and also replaced the fuel sending unit in the tank last year. The gimbal bearings, bellows, and seals were replaced and the drive unit was disassembled and checked and reinstalled 2 years ago along with new tires on the trailer. The boat has through the hull exhaust and is 20'9"" long and has a 44 gallon fuel tank which is full right now. This is a nice fun boat that will run about 60-65 MPH with 3 adults and a full tank of fuel according to gps before the ignition upgrade which I was told would increase performance and fuel economy of the boat. The deep V hull really smooths out choppy water and the handles great. I will include several life jackets with purchase of the boat which was just winterized 2 weeks ago.

97,,,2016-12-15 20:59,Was supposed to sell to someone in Orlando but I lost all my messages so wasn't able to sell them yet. I have 2 pro angles for sale. Both are the newer models with the vantage seat and rudder tension. The 2015 has a brand new never opened seat with it. One is a 2014 and the other is a 2015. The only difference in then is the 2015 has a drop down skeg and longer h-rails(side rails). The 2015 is the exact same as the newest PAs. The vantage seat has lumbar support. Both have the turbo fins mirage drive and also come with carbon fiber shaft  paddles. These are 3400 before tax.  There is so much you can do with these boats. Tons of room and a 500 pound weight limit.  Some people take dogs with them some people take kids with them some people even put a seat behind the vantage seat in the back and take another person fishing with them.  You can learn just about anything on YouTube to customize these Hobies to your liking. A very well known brand by fishers and one of the only pedal kayaks on the market.  Another positive about this pedal kayak is the pedal Mirage Drive is very simple and easy to use or maintain. Price is 2550$ each but willing to negotiate on a package deal. Feel free to call or text anytime.  Willing to deliver with a deposit. My number is 67886zero80two3. No trades or lowballs please.
