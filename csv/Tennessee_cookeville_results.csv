We do have some new and used single trailers we can add to this deal. 2014 Sea-Doo GTR 215 Nimble performance and peak value. The perfect pair. Strong and powerful, yet adaptable, this watercraft is one of the easiest ways to get into the musclecraft scene. It comes with a supercharged engine that offers more power than similar competitive models, and with features such as High-Performance VTS and Intelligent Brake and Reverse, it's the best value of any performance watercraft package. Key Features May Include: Performance & Handling High-Performance Variable Trim System (VTS) Quickly access the Variable Trim System (VTS) on the handlebar for fine-tuned handling based on rider preference, water conditions, and number of passengers. Supercharged Engine This Supercharged Engine offers more power than the Yamaha VXR and VXS. Touring / Sport Mode Choose from different riding styles with the touch of a button. Convenience Intelligent Throttle Control (ITC) Sea-Doo is the only watercraft that starts in neutral, so the engine runs without propelling the craft forward for safer dockside starts and easy, stress-free maneuverability. And because the throttle responds to an electronic signal instead of a cable, you enjoy better fuel economy and a lower operating cost. ECO Mode Automatically determines the most economical power delivery for the greatest fuel economy. Wide-Angle Mirrors Keep tabs on what's going on in your wake with helpful Wide-Angle Mirrors. Driving Center A sophisticated digital information center helps you stay in control with features like Touring/Sport Mode and ECO mode. Large Front Storage Comparment Enjoy plenty of water-resistant storage for stowing away your valuables. Closed-Loop Cooling System (CLCS) The industry's only Closed-Loop Cooling System (CLCS) that uses coolant -- instead of corrosive saltwater (and even debris) that can damage the engine -- to keep it running at ideal temperatures. Peace of Mind & Comfort Intelligent Brake & Reverse (IBR) Stop your watercraft with the squeeze of a lever. Squeeze it again to go in reverse. The brake handlebar is on the left and the acceleration on the right, allowing both hands to remain on the handlebars -- for more safety and effortless docking. Large Swim Platform A large Swim Platform with full traction matting makes hanging out in the sun or hopping in and out of the water a breeze. Touring Seat Plush, ergonomic design provides maximum comfort and support for driver and passenger. Digitally Encoded Security System (D.E.S.S.) This revolutionary system features a lanyard fitted with a computer chip, encoded specifically for your watercraft. Simple yet innovative, it's been singled out by the National Insurance Crime Bureau as one of the best theft deterrents available on a personal watercraft. Off-Throttle Assisted Steering (O.T.A.S.) Sea-Doo's Off-Throttle Assisted Steering system assists maneuverability in off-throttle situations. D-Sea-Bel Sound Reducing System Our patented sound reduction system uses resonators, acoustical foam and vibration-absorbing components to make Sea-Doo watercraft among the quietest on the water.

HIGH-OUTPUT ENGINE Provides reliable, ultra high-performance in salt and fresh water, giving you more power and efficiency. CHANGE ON THE FLY Choose from different riding styles with the touch of a button. INTUITIVE TECHNOLOGY Sea-Doo is the only watercraft that starts in neutral, so the engine runs without propelling the craft forward for safer dockside starts and easy, stress-free maneuverability. And because the throttle responds to an electronic signal instead of a cable, you enjoy better fuel economy and a lower operating cost. TAKE IT WITH YOU ON THE WATER Removable, watertight storage for all your gear, wet or dry. Portable design gives you quick, easy access to all your essentials. ONE-OF-A-KIND COOL The industry's only Closed-Loop Cooling System (CLCS) that uses coolant -- instead of corrosive saltwater (and even debris) that can damage the engine -- to keep it running at ideal temperatures. LESS DOCK TIME, MORE DOWN TIME Retractable mooring lines stow away when not in use. One in the bow and one in the stern. TOW LIKE A PRO A convenient Ski Tow Eye lets you pull your friends and family for any and all tow sports. FUN AND FUNCTIONAL This convenient storage compartment is located in the watercraft's platform for an additional storage option. STOP SOONER AND DOCK WITH EASE The world's first on-water braking system, iBR lets you stop up to 100 feet sooner than any other watercraft. All with the squeeze of a lever. And with its electronic reverse, it gives you a level of maneuverability that makes docking easier. *Based on internal testing. Based on commercially available competitive models as of August 2014.
