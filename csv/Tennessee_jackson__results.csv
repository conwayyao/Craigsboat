The principal advantage of this design is that it provides quick and safe mobility for 360 degrees around the vessel and places the boat operator out of the way of the action, yet in a position that affords excellent visibility and communication with the anglers. Standard features of the Coastal 2800 that make it so popular among anglers include standard rod racks on each side of the cockpit, removable in-deck fish boxes in the cockpit deck and a transom door for landing larger fish.
