I currently have 2 jobs, both in the downtown area, and I plan to dock the boat at Volunteer marina in downtown Knoxville. The problem I'm running into is that the bank will not loan on a boat that's more than 20 years old, so I need to purchase a reasonably priced boat that's newer than that or I'll need someone to work with me on payments. I have a down payment saved up and I'm ready to purchase, so if you have a boat that may work or know of someone who does, a call or email would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Matt P.S.
