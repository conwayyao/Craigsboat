This boat was bought new in 2013, as its manufactured date was November 2012. It only had 25.2 hours when I bought it. It comes with the Volvo Penta 5.7L 270 engine, swim platform that folds down in the middle, full snap cover, bimini top, dual stainless steel props, snap in carpet, dual batteries with switch, sterio/cd player w/ USB port, 6 speakers, anchor locker, stainless steel bow scuff plate, walk thru transom, ski locker, 2 captain chairs with bolster seats. Freshwater use only and never beached. If you have never seen a Cobalt, no attention to detail is overlooked, from the cupholders to the nice chrome accents, this boat has it all. This boat is clean as a whistle. No scratches, no scraps, no bad places in the upholstery....ABSOLUTELY no blemishes at all. There is no better ski boat than a Cobalt( I just sold a Crownline and there is no comparison). Being 23 feet and having a deep hull, it cuts thru other wakes at ease. I guarantee once you drive this boat you will want it. The best feature is the walk thru hull and no ladder to climb up! It plains out instantly and handles like a dream. This boat was purchased from a 61 year old woman who took it out a few times in 2013 & 2014, once in 2015 and I have been driving it since August 2016 and have already put 10+ hours on it and it runs great. It has always been stored at Sportsmans Boat Storage and has been maintained by them; winterizing, summarizing, etc. She had the oil changed every fall when the boat was winterized. The boat was purchased from Marine Sales in Pickwick and there is a TRANSFERRABLE FACTORY WARRENTY that is good thru 6-5-2018. As you can see in the last picture this boat NADA's for $55,870. Will sell for $53,000 OBO (price will be $56,000 on April 1,2017).  NADA does not take into consideration that this boat only has 25 hours on it. The average is 50 hours per year so NADA is assuming this boat has 200+ hours on it. You are getting basically a brand new boat, that sold new for $77,000, for only $53,000.
