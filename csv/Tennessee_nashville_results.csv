If you have ever spray painted something then you know spray paint just does not last. Powder coat is a more expensive process but is much more resistant to rust. It also keeps your trailer looking new for years to come. *One piece out side frames made from 4 inch box steel. Our trailers are unique in this manufacturing process. Most trailers use several welded pieces to achieve their shape. Ours are cut to length, then shaped creating a much stronger, cleaner looking trailer. The trailer listed here has a ""weight carrying capacity of 6420 lbs. *3 front stairs leading to a platform with a curved hand rail for safety. *9 lights with LED lights in the fenders. Lights make an object much more visible than reflective tape. *New, 13 inch, 6 ply trailer tires. *Acculube brand hubs featuring rubber unbreakable caps. *1500lb tongue jack with 2 wheels. *4 heavy duty drive on guides. *Rear heavy duty welded tie down eyelets. *Wide frame. This insures that no matter how wide your pontoon boat is, it will ride in the middle of the trailer for a much safer ride. Our wider frame also greatly reduces the risk of roll over while towing. *Written one year warranty. This gives our customers piece of mind in the purchase of their trailer. *Fully adjustable bunks, and stairs. We will even adjust the trailer to your boats specs to take the headache out of sizing. Compare our trailers and see why we earn such high praises from our customers. We would appreciate the opportunity to earn your business as well.

The boat is 18'-7"" long with a deep V hull. The wake it throws is great for riding behind! It has a 3 foot Swivel Ease ski pole to get the riders up and out. Stainless steel prop and whale tale on lower unit. This boat is made to handle rough chop on lakes and large wakes without being tossed around. The upholstery is in great shape and seats were replaced with original color, material and design scheme. I've kept this boat original and authentic which other Chris Craft admirers will appreciate. The full teak swim platform and teak wood trim are oiled regularly. New carpet was installed and bimini top is in good condition for shielding sun or rain. There is a storage cuddy forward which makes for an oasis for little guys or pets that need a nap. Also included is a Kenwood sound system with two amps and a subwoofer. There's a flasher depth finder and an Eagle GPS unit. The gelcoat and exterior of the boat are in good condition and has been buffed out to keep near original shine. The boat has always been well maintained. Oil changes every year, and winterized. This summer it's been out on Center Hill Lake 5 times for an afternoon maybe a total of 12-15 hours running time over the summer. That's about the average use every year for the last 5. It's stored inside at Holmes Creek Storage year round. Never been left out in the weather. There is a custom, full size cover included. Mechanically this boat is in good condition and with proper upkeep will last for years to come! Runs great, everything in good working order. Boat comes with a trailer that is in good shape. I can text more pictures for anything you'd like to see in detail on request. I'm sure I've left out some details, if you have any questions I will be happy to answer them.

MOST PAINT MANUFACTURES WILL ONLY WARRANTY THERE PAINT IF YOU STRIP YOUR CAR USING THE DUSTLESS BLASTING!!!! NO SANDING...NO WARPING...NO DUST...NO RUST FASTER CLEANER GREENER QUICKEST TURNAROUND TIME IN THE INDUSTRY WE CAN DO THE ENTIRE OUTSIDE OF A CAR IN ABOUT 2HRS!!! THIS IS NOT TRADITIONAL SAND OR SODA BLASTING, DUSTLESS BLASTING IS THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY IN BLASTING AND THE BEST WAY TO BLAST ANYTHING! WE CAN BLAST: STEEL, FIBERGLASS, ALUMINUM, CONCRETE, BRICK, CAR BODY'S, FRAME'S, PARTS, AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU NEED BLASTED!!! Dustless Blasting is drastically faster than sanding and soda blasting. Because the water reduces friction and prevents heat, there is no risk of warping like there is with sandblasting. Additionally when the Rust Inhibitor is used properly, chlorides are removed, giving a 48-72 hr flash time, and leaving a perfect paint ready surface. Dustless Blasting solves the warping problem caused by sand blasting, and the paint adhesion problems caused by soda blasting! It's faster, cleaner and greener than any other paint stripping technology available. The outside of most cars can be completely stripped in about 2 to 3 hours.
