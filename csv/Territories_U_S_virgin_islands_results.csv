Each of the incredibly buoyant hulls have a mere 3'3"" draft . And that gives you more than speed. It also lets you go into shallow water safely. So it's easy to beach the boat for on shore recreation, painting or repairs. Auxiliary twin diesels give you power plus maneuverability with one engine in each hull, 20 feet apart, you can ""spin on a dime"". This cat also give you more stability- lots more. With twin hulls, rock and roll is gone to stay and heeling is practically non-existent - a mere 19 degrees. All in all, much safer and saner than conventional boats. Smoother cruising ( without bouncing around) brings other benefits in addition to safety When coupled with the Cat's wide, flat working platform it means that fishing, even just walking around, is far less dangerous, strenuous and fatiguing. So at day's end you're not too tired to enjoy a good meal. (Which, by the way, is much easier to prepare, serve, and eat with no rock, roll or heel.) An important feature is that the main salon has 6'9"" head room and throughout the rest of the vessel the head room is 6'6"" Driven by new ( March 2012) twin 110 Horsepower Turbo Diesels ( 400 hours ), will go along at 9- 10 knots... And the twin hulls give you remarkable stability and maneuverability. What's more, this Cat uses less fuel than other power boats their size and larger. Will consume approximately 50% of the fuel of a similar sized monohull yet cruise twice as far. Uses 1.4 gals/ hour for each engine @ cruising speed of 9 knots. That gives a cruising range of 1,400 miles. Of course, for economy or in an emergency the catamaran will run on one engine and still give you total control. This cat has many other advantages over conventional boats but the one most .people appreciate is the incomparable flying bridge. Like every other area on the Cat, the bridge is big-10 feet wide by 12 feet long, with a complement of waterproof molded bench seats with cushions provides additional seating for 10 guests. It gives you the sun, a commanding view of the sea, and the certainty that the captain will be in on all the fun. ◦do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers",400,5886093953,46,C & C Logical,24' extra wide beam,$189000,power, (St Croix USVI),46' power catamaran New price drop!,https://virgin.craigslist.org/boa/5886093953.html,1985
