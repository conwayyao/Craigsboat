I put this boat together here locally but it was bought in the states and shipped brand new just 2 years ago. It is powered with a 70 Yamaha 4-stroke with 400 hours. Hydraulic steering, stainless rod holders, 8ft stainless bimini top, Furuno GPS/Sounder, 1Kw Airmar transducer, Icom VHF, LED lights, 30 Gallon built-in fuel tank.  This thing sips gas! She sits on a Coastline aluminium trailer with wired LED lights. This boat is a true seaworthy boat. You can find similar Yamaha style boats being used all over the world! It cuts through waves like a knife. Long and slender design makes it very efficient. I have meticulously taken care of this boat since day one.
