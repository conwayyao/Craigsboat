As of this year it has a new impeller, spark plugs, oil cap sensor, fuel filters, live-well pump, primer bulb, thermostats, tilt/trim relays, etc. Also, it was fully serviced (lower-unit oil, compression check, spark plugs, etc.) this November at NB's Boat Repair outside of Brownwood, Texas. Compression was good on all cylinders and I will obtain the exact reading from my mechanic along with an update on the current hours. This Cat features the following: -	18' Hull (black and yellow w/red accent striping) -	Red carpet (Original) -	Single Console w/Digital Dash -	Gen1 Lowrance HDS-5 at bow and Humminbird 898 SI/DI Combo at dash (both mounted on heavy-duty RAM mounts) -	175 EFI Mercury w/Tempest SS Prop and 10"" manual jack plate -	Hot-Foot Throttle -	SeaStar steering -	Minn Kota Onboard 3-Bank Charger (New) -	Two Interstate Batteries (Trolling) and one EverStart (Cranking) -	65lb Thrust Motor Guide Beast Trolling Motor w/Recessed Foot Pedal and extra prop -	Two matching bicycle and folding seats -	Matching tandem-axle Bass Cat trailer with upgraded jack, winch and Boat Buckle ratchet tie-downs -	Spare tire w/matching Bass Cat wheel -	Will include a variety of oils, greases, spare parts, etc. Hate to sell it, but I've only been able to take this boat out a hand full of times in the past year and a half. My original plan was to keep it as a backup, but I now know that it is impossible for me to fully utilize and care for two boats. It is time for someone else to enjoy this boat just as I have. It is fast, easily maneuvered, and way ahead of its time. No trades, no owner financing, and I am NOT desperate to sell. Cash only. Title along with all original paperwork in hand.
