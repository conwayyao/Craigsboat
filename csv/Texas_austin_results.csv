Slip ownership is an actual deeded piece of property but the great part is there are no property taxes because it is over water. Don't be fooled by all the other slips popping up now that the water is back.  Those were dry docked 6 months ago but not Lake Travis Marina.  Even in the worst drought we have seen over the past 10 years there was always at least 40 feet of water under the slips at Lake Travis Marina.  The Marina is professionally maintained and has 24/7 security video surveillance.  Comes with two key fobs for entry and exit.  The Marina has two onsite bathrooms and a shower for members.  Private boat launch for friends and family.  There is also a convenience store on site which has everything you need for a great day on the water...you even get a discount for slip owners.  This slip has full electric and water.  The slip is one of very few that has a professionally installed gutter to help with keeping water from coming into your boat.  The slip is located on the ""good"" side as it is shaded for most of the day and especially for protection from the brutal afternoon sun in the summer. The boat lift is one of the best ever built.  Again, not all lifts are the same.  This lift is a Poly Lift.  Most bolts used on lifts are 1/2 inch size, Poly Lift uses 5/8 inch bolts...big difference for the continuous motion it encounters.  The lift will hold a 6,000 lb boat and up to 26 feet.  As you can see from the pics it is in great shape.  This slip and lift need nothing.  Ready for years and years of fun.  The slip size is 10 feet by 24 feet. There is nothing better than not having to worry about trailering a boat and all the stresses that come with that along with fighting all the other people trying to launch etc.  It makes getting out on the water, even if just for a few hours, much more enjoyable.  Go enjoy a sunset without the hassle.  We have loved owning the slip but are moving out of town so it's time to pass along to some other lucky person. I will be glad to meet you out there to see it.  Thanks.
