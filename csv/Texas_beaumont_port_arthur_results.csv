Now that that's out of the way, let's get to the ad. I'm selling our Mac25.  We just had another baby, and we aren't going to be taking this boat out on the water anytime soon. The boat is in functional condition.  We have taken her out about a dozen times since Spring.  She isn't pretty.  The previous owner made a repair on the bow that was never sanded down and painted nicely.  There are nicks and scrapes on her hull.  But she does float and keeps the water out. We don't have an outboard for this boat.  The times we took her out, we just sailed away from the dock and sailed right back to it on Sabine Lake (nerve racking the first few times), so no engine included. There are 2 mainsails, a jib, a genoa, and a spinnaker included.  The sails are old.  The mainsails, jib and genoa all had tears or seams ripped when we bought the boat, but we just patched them with sail tape (we applied the sail tape and then sewed the tape on).  The sails work fine, and should last a while. We replaced the sheets, and we bought line to replace the halyards, but we didn't get around to the halyards. We replace all the blocks. I replaced the pivot bolt for the swing keel when it broke (that was exciting). A trailer is included, but we don't have the title for the trailer.  We do have a clear title in my name for the boat. The cusions that came with the boat were trash, so that's where they ended up.  We removed the interior woodwork and walls, but we still have them so you can reinstall if you wish.  The interior is bare. The electronics on the boat need to be totally redone.  We removed most of the old switches and terminals, but we left the wires.  We never really sailed at night, so we never needed the lights. All in all she's a great boat to learn on, and wouldn't be too difficult to fix up if you wanted to make her pretty. I would be interested in trading if you have a smaller sailboat in good condition.  This boat is a little big for me to rig and launch by myself, but I would definitely be interested in a 15-20' boat and trailer if you want to trade.",,5844636231,30.094800,25,-94.164800,MacGregor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@30.094800,-94.164800,16z",Mac25,$2000,sail," (Beaumont, TX)",25' MacGregor 1982 Mac25 Sailboat,https://beaumont.craigslist.org/boa/5844636231.html,1982
