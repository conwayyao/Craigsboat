New gang switches for bilge pump, navigation lights, headlights and cockpit/decklights. Boat has new wiring to the bow for LED lighting. Also wiring is already there for high pressure sodium lights if you prefer those instead. All aluminum deck on the front is completely removable if you wanted to fish out of boat as well. Trailer is tandem axle all galvanized. New tires. If you're looking for a good boat with lots of room for bowfishing, this is it. Don't spend $25,000 and get a little boat. Just add your motor and come out with a rig that does everything you want and more. Asking $10,500 or best offer. Might be open to some trades. Let me know what you got and we will talk. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. 931-2zero9-0014 cell...I'm in College Station and Bryan TX. Don't let the number fool you.

I've fished on better dedicated bass boats, and I've skied on better dedicated ski boats, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a boat that does both as well as the Reata.  My kids are teenagers now (all four of them), and we want to get a dedicated ski boat to bring all the friends along.  The boys and I will have to settle for a little jon boat to do our fishing. As you can see, the boat is in excellent condition (although there is upholstery wear in the center seat), and it looks even better on the water.  I haven't done a compression test because Bryan Marina is basically the only show in town, and they refuse to work on anything that isn't made in America.  The entire axle and hub assemblies on the trailer are brand new.  Convertible top.  Ski locker.  Rod locker.  Live well.  Cooler.  Three batteries (one for the starter, two for everything else).  Kota trolling motor.  Garmin and Lowrance depth/fish finders.  Clarion AM/FM/CD/AUX/Satellite receiver.  Hinged trailer hitch. We've fished, skied, tubed, and wake boarded on this boat.  You'll have no problem popping up an adult slalom skier on a plane.  This boat has never been in salt water. I have clear titles for the boat and motor in hand.
