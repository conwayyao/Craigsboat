Over the past 25 years, the engineers at Ranger have fine-tuned both the performance and conveniences on this boat to ensure the highest standards in quality and innovations. According to Boating Magazine in their 2010 trial test run, ""The Z521 Comanche runs like a thoroughbred greyhound."" While other bass boats are not designed to handle easily at high speeds, you will remain fully in control at top speeds of 65-70mph. Whether you're fishing with buddies or competitively, you will appreciate the live wells, rod lockers and tackle storage areas have all been uniquely designed to make gear management easy even in rough weather. Lowrance electronics. Custom Ranger steel trailer with swing-away tongue provides easy storage. The trailer is in good condition. If you're thinking of buying new, please check this beauty out first! INFORMATION ON CONDITION: Seller has taken excellent care of her and says everything is in good working order. The boat is no longer under warranty. Comes with a factory full-boat cover. Trolling motor batteries should be replaced every 5 years. Two out of three batteries are questionable and will most likely need to be replaced in the near future.
