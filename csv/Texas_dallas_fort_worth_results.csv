They do NOT issue titles for jetskis in Arkansas. It was only used for a few years on a private lake before it had engine issues and was put in a corner of the garage and became a ""one of these days"" project. It was never ridden on a public waterway and so was never registered. A few years later I put another motor in it and added a few bolt on parts.. pipe, waterbox, plate and SS prop. Had a cheap paint job put on it and some after market pads. That's been over 15 yrs ago before the starter went bad. Makes a squealing sound when engaging and will need to be replaced. Other than that it's not perfect, but not bad. I've since moved here to Texas have lost interest in it and can use the space and the cash. I've talked to Parks and Wildlife about the titling and registration and they've walked me thru the procedure. Apparently, it's less complicated because of it never having been registered, there or here. If you've read this far then you've probably either done this before or know someone who has.

I apologize if I have not replied to you. It needs most of the accessories wired....I think every thing works but I don't have the time to rewire. It starts good and idles excellent after it warms up. It bogs down at full throttle so it probably would benefit from a tune up. transom wood may be getting soft but the transom is solid.  I have the boat title from the previous owner (not sure he filled it out correct). I do not have a title for the motor.  the boat floats and runs but isnt new. That being said, as stated, you can take it fishing today.  with the lake temps dropping, the fish have been biting strong！ Tags are good till March 17 I believe.
