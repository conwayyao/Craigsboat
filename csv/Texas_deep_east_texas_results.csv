97,excellent,[],2016-11-14 12:46,"2004 Stratos 201 ProXL Power Boat FOR SALE - ASKING $21,000 obo. --- Make me an offer! MANUFACTURER DETAILS: 2004 Stratos Boat 201 Pro XL SPECIFICATIONS: Boat Type: Outboard Boats Engine Specifications: Quantity: 1 Horse Power: 250 Type: Gasoline Hull Material: Fiberglass Beam: 7'11"" Length: 21' Net Weight (lbs): 1550 DETAILED DESCRIPTION: I've had this boat since 2009, and never had to work on the motor.  I fish all over TX and have never had to worry about making it back to the boat ramp. It has the Mercury ""SMARTCRAFT"" computer installed so you can monitor EVERYTHING that's going on with your motor as you're running, which is an excellent tool to have because you can fine tune your Tilt/Trim as you're driving for optimum fuel mileage.  I typically use 3-6 gallons less per day than my buddies, when we fish together.  I put a new MinnKota 101 Fortrex on it. That's about 2 years old. The 21k price includes my Lowrance HDS-12 Touch at the console, and a matching HDS-7 at the front. I've had the GPS at 73 , but it's got more than that. I think I'm the 3rd owner of the boat, for whatever that's worth. This boat lives in an enclosed garage, with a fan on it just to make sure it stays good and dry. Carpet, and seats are in good shape, with only a couple tiny holes in the seats. I wasn't especially looking for a Stratos when I found this one, but it sold me when I saw the storage on this boat. You can literally haul ALL of your stuff with you onboard! Like all nice boats these days it has all the fancy stuff including hydro steering and hydraulic jack plate that you can adjust with a dial which is great for driving in shallower waters. You can move it up and down for a different ride depending on the conditions. I put 4 new Goodyear Marathon Tires on this past spring, and installed all new LED lights as well. Serious buyers, Please do feel free to ask questions, as I know everything about this boat.  Just shoot me a message and I will reply back directly.
