68,good,,2016-12-07 21:24,"This McKee Craft boat is designed for bay fishing in mind. The W type hull allows this small boat to be very stable and float in very shallow water. With no people in the boat and the motor trimmed up the boat will float in 5 inches of water. The boat is equipped with a 40hp Force motor which is a company owned by Mercury Marine. The 2 stroke power of the motor delivers a high power to weight ratio and can push the boat to 28mph according to my smartphone. The motor runs well and has never given me any problems. The motor has been maintained well and had a full service performed last year. The carburetor was cleaned, new spark plug wires and spark plugs were installed, and the lower unit gear oil was changed. A few years ago the steering cable and mechanism were replaced. All components of the vessel work as they should including the Humminbird 400TX fishfinder and the navigation lights. The trailer was re-wired two weeks ago and waterproof LED lights were installed. Three years ago the axle and hubs were replaced, a new jack, new strap winch, and new wheels and tires were installed. Overall this is a turn key boat and it can have you out on the water tomorrow. Along with the boat, I am including all of the dock lines I have, a portable fuel tank, oil, an oar, and the vessels anchor. Flounder season is almost here and this boat can help you catch more fish. If you have any other questions feel free to text or call me. Offers welcome. You may notice that the boat is registered to NJ and has an NJ license plate and that my phone number has a NJ area code. That is because I am a student down here is Texas and still have a NJ phone number and plates.
