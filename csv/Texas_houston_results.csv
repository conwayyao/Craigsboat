If you are interested, give me a call. I'm negotiable.  I have clear titles and registrations for everything.  If you have a Harley-Davidson I may be willing to trade.

Cockpit has flip-up and adjustable helm seat, windshield power vent, full carpet and stereo control and electric engine hatch. The 300 is a nicely proportioned sun-bridge cruiser with a forward-swept radar arch, big swim grid, and spacious cockpit.The 300s bright interior is well laid out and faultlessly finished, and the port-side galley has plenty of storage. The helm station (lower left) has seating for two and an ergonomically-designed dash.Aft of the dinette, the lower stateroom (below) has enough space to qualify as a real daytime lounging area. Sea Ray 300 Sundancer SEA RAY'S SPORT CRUISER IS A NICELY-BALANCED 30-FOOTER WITH SOLID HANDLING AND PLENTY OF ROOM TO STRETCH OUT. LOA 30"" Beam 10'5"" Draft (legs down) 40"" (legs up) 24"" Displ. 12,500 lbs Deadrise 21Ã‚Âº Power Twin 5.0L Mercruisers Fuel 142 Imp. gals (644L) Water 29 Imp. gals (133L) Holding 23 Imp. gals (106L) The 300 Sundancer's styling is unmistakably Sea Ray, but it stands out for its superb balance between boat size and living space., Sea Ray has responded to rising customer expectations by adding lots of standard equipment that used to be considered optional. The extensive standard inventory for the Sundancer 300 includes a Panasonic TV/ VCR, microwave, hot and cold pressure water, VHF and depth sounder, and an impressive Clarion stereo system (6- stacker CD changer, cockpit and cabin speakers, dashboard remote and built-in CD rack). Only navigational electronics are not included as standard, chiefly because every customer seems to have a different idea of what constitutes the perfect package. Standard power in the 300 has recently been increased to twin Mercruiser 5.0 litre multi-port fuel-injected engines with stern drives. The engines are accessed via a huge electric-lift cockpit hatch with stainless steps leading down, and good access to most service points. Installation of ancillary systems is tidy and well laid out. COCKPIT AND DECK The 300 is boarded from the stern via the swim-grid and a transom door. Discreet molded-in steps at deck level and just up from the swim-grid allow easy boarding from raised docks. The raised helm station has a double bench with flip-up thigh bolster, tilting Momo wheel and a full range of classy-looking analogue gauges. By placing the gauges well ahead of the helm, Sea Ray has made room to position the numerous switches and controls within handy reach, as well as space for mounting the navigation electronics ""front-and-center."" Moreover, the gauges are easier to monitor without taking your eyes off the water. Just aft of the helm are fore and aft-facing benches for five guests (or perhaps seven close friends) all upholstered in white vinyl. On the port side of the cockpit is a wet bar with sink, spray attachment, fridge and storage.The fastback cockpit canvas provides a slightly sleeker look at the cost of some enclosed cockpit space. The deck is uncluttered, and all exposed fittings are stainless. At the bow, a Lofrans windlass feeds into an ample, although unpartitioned, chain locker. ACCOMMODATIONS Below decks, the 300 is finished in a bright, contemporary style. The cherry-laminate cabinetry is pleasing to the eye and should prove durable, Upholstery is a beige faux-leather, and the cabin sides are cream colored vinyl. Four opening stainless ports and three overhead hatches provide fresh air and light. The port-side galley features abundant storage, Corian counters, a two-burner alcohol/electric stove, range vent, microwave and a Norcold fridge with an ice-cube freezer.
