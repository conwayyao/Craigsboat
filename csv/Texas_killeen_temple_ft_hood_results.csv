Newer tires and nice chrome wheels. Has the Chevy 350 v8 engine with low original hours. Never been in salt water only in freshwater. Engine just had the carb rebuilt and tune-up done. It runs well. Plenty of power to pull tubers and skiers with ease. This boat is unique compared to other boats its size because it has a deeper V hull than others to help cut through the waves and rough waters. You can really tell a difference if you have ever had a smaller boat in rougher water without a deep V hull. Newer Bimini top that was custom made for the boat. The owner before me had the floor replaced. The interior is original and in good shape for the age. Has a few rips on the seats but mainly on the rear sun deck. Nice aftermarket CD player and speakers. Everything on the boat works as it should. It has always been kept inside when not being used. It's a really nice boat and really hate to sell it but we have a newborn and really don't get to take it out as much as we would like.  The registration and trailer tag was just done.

It is a privately owned boat being sold on consignment at Stressless Auto on behalf of the owner. Consignment sales give you the best of both worlds: you get a well cared for, privately owned car with a known history as well as the ease and security of working with a very service focused, specialty dealer. The Correct Craft SkiTique was a well renowned ski boat in the early 1980s -- it was really the cat's meow.  This is a two-owner boat, with both owners living here in Austin.  The first owner bought it at a boat show in 1982 here in town.  He sold it to the current owner, who collects classic cars and has taken every precaution to ensure this boat stays like new. This boat is all original, except for the bottom cushion on the two front seats.  It has the original Ford 302 V8 engine, original trailer, original gel coat, original carpet, and original vinyl.  It runs beautifully and is a lot of fun for a day on the lake. The trailer has good tires, new lights, and just passed a TX safety inspection. Please take a look at all of the photos on our website here: http://stresslessauto.com/inventory/1982-correct-craft-skitique/ Please call, text, or email through the link above with any questions you might have. This awesome car can be seen at Stressless Auto's INDOOR SHOWROOM, near the corner of Metric Blvd and Rutland Dr.  We show vehicles by appointment to ensure you are given the attention you deserve.
