It is a privately owned boat being sold on consignment at Stressless Auto on behalf of the owner. Consignment sales give you the best of both worlds: you get a well cared for, privately owned car with a known history as well as the ease and security of working with a very service focused, specialty dealer. The Correct Craft SkiTique was a well renowned ski boat in the early 1980s -- it was really the cat's meow.  This is a two-owner boat, with both owners living here in Austin.  The first owner bought it at a boat show in 1982 here in town.  He sold it to the current owner, who collects classic cars and has taken every precaution to ensure this boat stays like new. This boat is all original, except for the bottom cushion on the two front seats.  It has the original Ford 302 V8 engine, original trailer, original gel coat, original carpet, and original vinyl.  It runs beautifully and is a lot of fun for a day on the lake. The trailer has good tires, new lights, and just passed a TX safety inspection.

Cobra uses the highest quality high density material (HDPE) compared with other brands that use lower quality, lower density product. Therefore these are the strongest (and lightest) recreational kayaks on the market. I have two Play models available.  One Lime Green and one Camo.  These kayaks are brand new and comes complete with the following features: *Drain Plug *Multi Position Foot Rests *Self Draining Scuppers *Accessory Eyelets *End & Side Luggage Handles *6″ Day Hatch with Net Bag *Seat *Paddle *Length: 10' 1"" *Width: 28"" *Weight: 40 lbs. *Capacity: 260 lbs. The Play is the most versatile kayak available today! Designed for smaller, shorter paddlers and kids the Play is also great kayak for paddlers up to 200 lbs. At only 31 lbs the Play is lightweight and compact, simple to transport, load and unload and can be quickly launched and easily maneuvered. Stability is provided by a shallow V-shaped hull that enhances maneuverability and tracking. The clean deck design, comfortable cockpit area and rounded ergonomic shapes make it easy to use. Three different foot positions for different length legs make it an excellent choice for sharing by the whole family or a group of friends. This setup with paddle and seat included retails for $709.00 plus tax (plus another $99 for shipping as these are almost impossible to find locally). This kayak is for local pickup in the New Braunfels/Canyon Lake area of south Texas.  However, I can possibly arrange to deliver the kayak within a 60 mile radius of Canyon Lake/New Braunfels for an additional $50. Not interested in trades.  Please email me with any questions.

When I tested it, it ran great up to about 40 mph and then bogged. I turned around to bring it in for more adjustment and it died with a thunk and wouldn't restart. We found that the engine is ""locked up."" I later realized that we adjusted the carburetor with the fuel switch off. Although I hate to get rid of it, I'm selling this jetski for parts and am including the trailer. This is a 3-seater and was a blast to ride with plenty of power to pull boarders or skiers! I have the title in hand. Both the trailer and jetski have some cosmetic damage: for example, dings, scratches, sun damage, but functionally they are good except for the locked up engine. The trailer has a long tongue which makes it much easier to back. If you don't like my asking price, please make me an offer. Repair history in last 4 years (receipts available): May, 2014: New used pump, wear rings and impeller June, 2014: Replaced impeller with propeller. Works great!
