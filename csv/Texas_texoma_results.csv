72,,,2016-12-06 18:02,"This is a 2000 model Sprint 18' bass boat with a 2000 model Mercury XR6 engine that purrs like new whether idling along trolling or hammering down across the lake. Right off the bat, this was my dad's boat who passed about a month ago so this is basically an estate type of sale so no, we are not interested in any trades period. I will not even respond to trade offers. I have fished on this boat a lot and helped my dad keep it up along with my sister and brother in law and to the best of my knowledge, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Having said that, it is a used boat and has been used show it shows signs of wear although the seats have no rips or tears that i know of. The engine, again is a Mercury XR6 150 hp and starts right up every time and runs as smooth as you can imagine. It also has a ""Hot foot"" pedal instead of a traditional hand throttle. My dad typically had the water pump replaced every couple of years and he had the complete lower unit rebuilt earlier this year at Tadpoles marine. My dad was 80 when he passed and although he would still go out and launch the boat by himself when he couldn't find anyone to go with him, he didn't have the arm strength to hand winch the boat back onto the trailer so it has a small Warn winch in place of a hand winch. The boat has a 24 volt Motorguide trolling motor up front as well as a Minn Kota trolling motor with a slapper prop fish attractant on the back. It has power steering and added rod holders through out. Electronics include a Hummingbird fishfinder 525 up front and a brand new Lowrance Elite-4 HDI at the drivers position. All 3 of the batteries are good and the boat is registered through June of '17. It also has a built in battery charger for the trolling batteries. It comes with two covers. The light one needs some repair because i ripped it putting it back on after cleaning my dads stuff out of it but it also comes with a heavy one. The boat also comes with a few life jackets and seat throw preservers as well as an orr, etc.",,5885373013,,18,,,,,$8900,power, (Durant),18' Sprint bass boat 150 Hp Mercury,https://texoma.craigslist.org/boa/5885373013.html,
