I inherited it from my late father, who lived on the Mississippi River and was never able to use it much due to family health issues. It was used a few times a year, and sometimes not at all for over a year. It sat in a heated garage the entire time. Soon as I got it here to Texas, I had all routine maintenance done, like impeller shaft, etc. I also added a canopy for about $600-, as well as new tires and bearings on the trailer. Boat has live well, bilge pump, front storage, depth gauge, auto-lift on motor, can get really shallow as a result of design. It starts up immediately and runs flawlessly, and the 60 horse Yamaha 4 stroke motor is quiet yet powerful. Running lights for legal after dark hours. Trailer has new wood slats and guideposts for deep water launches, lights work, no issues. No leaks, and everything works. I'm not looking for trades, or low-ball offers. I know what the boat is worth. One similar model just sold for $12K. Another one is for sale for 13K in Houston CL, and thats a 2004. If you want a boat that will require nothing but fishing poles and gas, here you are. $ave thousands. License is current, tags are current, titles are clear on motor, boat, trailer. PS- I have had offers for  7500-7700-8000 and turned them down. I am asking 9K, we can go from there. I just took it out fishing on Decker last week. Easy launch, easy load.
