An impression lasts a lifetime. Regal engineers luxury, innovation and performance into every model to exceed the standards of experts around the world. The beauty of every Regal boat is the essence of its craftsmanship, from each section of hand-laid fiberglass to every handcrafted piece of vinyl. The phrase ""entry-level"" has become synonymous with small bow riders. But when you come across a 19-footer distinguished by signature graphics and eye-catching colors, loaded with equipment, with an 8-foot-3 beam, 39 cubic feet of storage and space for nine adults, it's not fair to call it entry level. You better call it a Regal. The FasTrac hull gives you more control on the water, with up to 26% faster speeds, and at the fuel pump, with up to 30% better fuel efficiency. The expansive social seating in the cockpit provides a great entertaining area for up to 9 people and you will enjoy the unique design of the multi-position backrest. It gives you the functionality of a bucket seat, combined with the social cockpit of an arena seat. The transom sunpad provides for a great place to soak up the sun and spend time with friends. And the extended swim platform is safe, easy to board, and completely covers the drive. And with Volvo's Top-shelf sterndrive power means an incredibly smooth, quiet ride. This particular 1900 ESX was ordered with an exceptional trim level. It starts with the Volvo V6-240 MPI engine (240php) coupled with Volvo's stern drive with Volvo ""Cone Clutching System"" for maximum hole shot and top end performance. Most standard features on a Regal boat are optional equipment on most other manufacturer's boats so this boat is pack with standard equipment. The most notable standard and optional equipment on this boat include: * Two Tone Flame Red and Black Hull with Color Matched Titanium Interior * Upgraded Volvo V6-240 MPI Engine * Closed Water Cooling System * Color Matched Metalcraft Tandem Axle Trailer w/ Brakes, Spare Tire, and Load Guides * Fusion® MS650 Audio System w/ Bluetooth, Pandora, Sirius Capabilities and (4) Cockpit Speakers * Watersports Tower (Black) w/ Integrated Bimini Top * Helm Flip-Up Bolster * Transom Trim Switch * SeaDek Swim Platform Matting * Cockpit Blue LED Lighting * Snap Out Carpet * Travel/Storage Cover * Battery Switch w/ Battery * Digital Depth Sounder * Removable Cooler * Walk Thru Transom w/ Filler Cushion * 5-Position Tilt Steering Wheel",,5899879097,,19,,Regal,https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%33%33%30%32+East+Main+Street+Mesa+UT+US,1900 ESX,,power,,2017 Regal 1900 ESX,https://saltlakecity.craigslist.org/bod/5899879097.html,2017

Call Shawn Today!! Part of Centurion's Air Warrior series, which reaches out to first-time buyers with performance and comfort in mid-priced packages, the Elite V C4 is a versatile V-drive with lots of interior space. The standard features, such as the aluminum tower and center ballast tank, cater to its wakeboarding-oriented personality, while creature comforts on board, like snap-in carpet, make this boat family-friendly too. The Elite V C4 measures 21.5 feet long, but the interior layout maximizes space in the wakeboard boat, making the main lounge feel remarkably spacious. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS Centurion groups its options into packages, so depending on how serious wakeboarding fits into your budget and priority list, you can choose accordingly. For the best wakes this boat has to offer, use the trim tab for wake shaping, and both center and dual ballast tanks for increased size. But even with the Air Warrior package, which includes a center tank only, wakes feature steep transitions that are good for poppy wake-to-wake moves. The V-shaped hull allows this boat to plow through chop and double-ups with no problem. Handling and tracking are impressive for a boat of this size, and it also holds speed well, even without speed control. SPECS Passengers: 10 Dry weight: 3,500 lb. Draft: 29 in.

In fact, this is one nimble 24-footer. With or without ballast, the 247 turns well, accelerates quickly and doesn’t dip the bow.

You won’t have to worry about the prop wash coming over the transom with a fully loaded boat, and because of the high gunnels, you get more ergonomic seats with higher backs.

Sure, you can opt for a tower like our test boat had, but this is really a classic direct-drive ski boat, perfect for shortline sets on a private lake with just your ski partner at dawn, or in the heat of a weekend three-event tournament. What you can't see is what's below the surface, namely a hull with a deeper V than traditional ski boats and an adjustable wake plate that comes standard. Combined, those two features help take the T5 off the private ski sites and onto public waters, giving not-so-serious skiers an amazing pull that can get them hooked on the sport. Even in less than ideal conditions, the T5 can perform like a champ. It also helps that the visibility from the driver's seat is exceptional, looking forward and looking back. The rear seat backs are low so the rope from the ski pylon has plenty of clearance. The open bow with walk-through makes room for the kids to join the skiing fun, too. SKIING The lack of spray from behind the T5 earned a perfect 10 from our test team, who had no problems at short line lengths. The table is narrow and the wakes are soft, which beginners will appreciate when trying 15 off at slower speeds. No matter our line length, the T5 tracked on a straight path, then turned nimbly and powerfully for the next pass. We found the T5 to be somewhat sensitive to weight distribution, and the rear trunk is on the small side and wouldn't accommodate a 68-inch ski. But aside from that, the T5 is one of those rare boats that can satisfy novice skiers just as much as the slalom veterans. LOWDOWN • Tournament-level ski boat for hard-core competitors. • Deeper V and wake plate carry over that top-notch performance from private to public lakes. • Clean, simple styling puts emphasis on the skiing. • Among the best ski boats we've seen in eliminating spray. • Walkways alongside center-mounted engine box are surprisingly wide. • Open bow lets more than just a ski partner come aboard. • Hole shot to 36 mph dips closer to 5 seconds with upgrade to 340-horsepower 6.2-liter MerCruiser.

Perfect combo. The Malibu Wakesetter 23 LSV has worked great for Darin Shapiro at his wakeboard camp in Florida. He can show his skills behind it and load up a class of students on it. It hits the sweet spot of being big without being oversized. At 23 feet, it can go up against a lot of 21-footers and do very well in acceleration to 23 mph and handling in straight shots and through double-ups – even outperforming some of those smaller wakeboard boats. And Malibu Boats always, always nails the sweet spot when it comes to construction and comfort. The wakeboard boat hums – no “What was that sound?!” There’s total plushness of padding in the bow, lounge and sun pad. It’s stylish, it’s solid, it’s sweet. ADVERTISING Illusion X Tower Gotta love the swoop, the color, the look. Built-in navigation light and the quick collapse are beauts, too. Ballast tanks Four standard tanks add up to 1,250 pounds, yet in the floor they don’t subtract from storage space. Ballast Monitoring System The LCD dash display keeps track of how full each of the four tanks is thanks to a bar graph. Power Wedge A new feature for ’06, it shapes wakes on the fly in five settings. Well worth springing for as an option. Precision Pro Speed Control Whether you get the 340-, 400- or 450-horsepower engine, all come standard with this new cruise control. Wake Shape Good for everybody. They stay so smooth, even if you’re an advanced rider wanting to max out the ballast system and the Malibu Power Wedge. Wakes get big, yeah, but the transition stays long and trough-free. Peak is rounded in a good way. The landing zone stretches out with a forgiving feel. It’s easy to make double-ups, as Gorilla fins on the hull plunge into the water for a pivot point in tight turns. Beginners with their first wake-school lesson appreciate the smoothness too, after you go easy on the ballast and the Wedge. Specs Length 23 ft. Beam 100 in. Seating capacity 14 Fuel capacity 55 gal.

86,fair,,2016-11-26 07:50,"We have a 1975 Yukon Delta house boat with trailer for sale. This is a PROJECT boat. We bought it in March of 2015 with the intention of fixing it up and using it, but we have not had the time. After sitting for two summers, it's time to let it go to someone who will use it. The person we bought it from said that it does float, but we never got it out on the water. It doesn't have any holes in the hull. He also said that the motor will not stay running, but he thought it would be a pretty easy fix (he thought it was the points). We have not tried to work on the motor, but we do have the manual. The inside was gutted, and we did put new outdoor carpet in the cabin. It needs a new roof, and we have the materials to fiberglass the roof it after new plywood is put on it. The cabin is 13 feet long, and I think the overall length of the boat is around 26 feet. We do not know the weight. We pulled it from Fairplay to Wheat Ridge with a 2006 Toyota Tundra V8, but it was really taxing the Tundra, so you'll probably need a bigger truck. We have a lot of parts and pieces that were inside the boat when we got it, and it will all be included, along with the pictured oven and refrigerator. We don't know much more about the boat than what is in this ad.
