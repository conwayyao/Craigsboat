Beam 93 in. Seating capacity 10 Fuel capacity 35 gal. Test prop Acme 13.5x17.5 4-blade Test engine Indmar Monsoon EFI-PFI, 335 HP Top speed 46.9 mph 5,050 rpm Accel. to 30 mph 5.0 sec. 120.1 ft. Accel. to 36 mph 6.5 sec. 189.5 ft. Noise levels (db) Neutral 64 D 60 R, 36 mph 85 D 90 R TheWakesetter VLX was one of the few boats in our tests that we wanted to ride behind all day and never give back. Sporting a progressive appearance dressed in the Wakesetter tribal art and sculpted with flowing lines, Malibu's flagship wakeboarding boat screams high intensity. (Unfortunately, Malibu screamed, ""Give it back!"") Before we started our set, we loaded up the standard rear and center MLS ballast, then deployed the optional Wedge 23. All together, that added the equivalent of 1,900 pounds of ballast. Formed with the deep-hull design, the world-class wakes had huge, smooth, solid swells. The Indmar Monsoon 335 engine has a 10-horsepower increase from last year, so the boat has more than enough juice when fully weighted. But it's more than just a massive wake-producing machine. Built with the FibECS stringer and through-bolted engine-mounting system, it takes on rough conditions like a champ and punches through double-ups with ease. An expansive interior layout incorporates numerous storage options and is accentuated with stainless-steel grab rails and new chrome-billet Malibu signature emblems. The driver gets a hand-stitched wrapped dash that offers great visibility. For true customization, the swiveling driver's seat has built-in adjustable automotive-style lumbar support. Get the optional driver's seat heating element for those cool morning sessions. The captain of this gem doesn't get all the love. Luxury features are spread throughout the boat for the entire crew. There's a large cooler, a removable refreshment table and multiple 12-volt outlets for operating a fat sack or even a blender. For those late evening sessions, lighted bow and gunwale storage will help guide you safely through the cockpit. Passengers can relax in ergonomically shaped seats with orthopedic variable-density foam, giving you padding where you need it most. When you combine the Wakesetter VLX's razor-sharp appearance, luxury feel and, most important, its impeccable wakeboarding performance, it's a boat equation that's tough to beat. After a test ride in this baby, you won't want to give it back, either. The Lowdown •The massive wakes are well-sculpted ramps that will please even the most demanding riders. •The optional Illusion tower has a progressive look and eliminates any driver view blockage. •Wraparound seating has room for everybody to be comfortable, while a profusion of storage compartments hides your crew's gear. •A hard-hitting JBL stereo features a standard MP3 plug that adds versatility to your music. •Dual gas fills allow idiot-proof fill-ups at the pump. •Takes on rough conditions like a champ and punches through double-ups rock solid.

Sure, you can opt for a tower like our test boat had, but this is really a classic direct-drive ski boat, perfect for shortline sets on a private lake with just your ski partner at dawn, or in the heat of a weekend three-event tournament. What you can't see is what's below the surface, namely a hull with a deeper V than traditional ski boats and an adjustable wake plate that comes standard. Combined, those two features help take the T5 off the private ski sites and onto public waters, giving not-so-serious skiers an amazing pull that can get them hooked on the sport. Even in less than ideal conditions, the T5 can perform like a champ. It also helps that the visibility from the driver's seat is exceptional, looking forward and looking back. The rear seat backs are low so the rope from the ski pylon has plenty of clearance. The open bow with walk-through makes room for the kids to join the skiing fun, too. SKIING The lack of spray from behind the T5 earned a perfect 10 from our test team, who had no problems at short line lengths. The table is narrow and the wakes are soft, which beginners will appreciate when trying 15 off at slower speeds. No matter our line length, the T5 tracked on a straight path, then turned nimbly and powerfully for the next pass. We found the T5 to be somewhat sensitive to weight distribution, and the rear trunk is on the small side and wouldn't accommodate a 68-inch ski. But aside from that, the T5 is one of those rare boats that can satisfy novice skiers just as much as the slalom veterans. LOWDOWN • Tournament-level ski boat for hard-core competitors. • Deeper V and wake plate carry over that top-notch performance from private to public lakes. • Clean, simple styling puts emphasis on the skiing. • Among the best ski boats we've seen in eliminating spray. • Walkways alongside center-mounted engine box are surprisingly wide. • Open bow lets more than just a ski partner come aboard. • Hole shot to 36 mph dips closer to 5 seconds with upgrade to 340-horsepower 6.2-liter MerCruiser.

I bought this out of Fullerton California and I have not taken it out on the lake since I purchased it. The boat and trailer had been sitting for at least six years. The last registration sticker on the boat is from 2001. There is even a dealer sticker on the boat from Fullerton, so the boat may not have even left the original town it was purchased new from. When I got it, I repainted the interior and replaced the wooden benches. The benches have been wrapped in new carpet. The boat is VERY straight and certainly not all beat up like many other older aluminum boats. I repainted the trailer and put a brand new axle, new wheel bearings, new tires and wheels on it. The boat comes with a 20 HP Johnson two stroke outboard motor that I picked up earlier this year from someone from Northern Utah. I originally bought the motor and ran it on a different boat I had at the time -- a 12'3"" Gregor aluminum boat, and it pushed the boat and at least 250 pounds (not including the motor itself) at I believe 20-25 mph on a GPS speedometer reading. The motor will need a fuel tank and a fuel line and connector as I am keeping the tank I have for my other boat. Great little fishing boat for small bodies of water.

They fill up really fast and gives the wake an incredible shape. the engine (Indmar 350) is extremely reliable and gives more than enough power to get anyone out of the water. I will try and find some pictures of the wake to add. I have ridden behind a couple different boats (axis, Mastercraft, Malibu..) and as a personal opinion I think this wake is the best of any boat of this era. The surf wake is huge and holds its shape allowing you to surf 20+ feet away from the deck. The wakeboarding wake has a great transition and a sharp top giving tons of pop. I have started riding a little bit faster (23 MPH) than I have behind other boats because the wake really takes shape at that speed.
