It will come with a barefoot boom and a trailer with brand new hubs, bearings, and tires. The boat has a 351 and I am the second owner. The first was a professional skier! This boat is amazing for skiing and wake boarding and has a lot of power. It runs great with no mechanical problems and is ready for a new home. The stringers are perfect. I have no problem keeping it and it will be especially hard to want to sell it when lake season comes in. Get in contact with me and we can talk more about it. I am Jason and my number is show contact info Thanks so much for viewing my ad! I am somewhat negotiable on the boat but a lot of money has gone into it and I have receipts for some of the things done to it. :) Have a great day and I look forward to speaking with you! tags: ski, boat, wakeboat, skiboat, slalom, lake, sml, family boat, speedboat, speed boat, fast boat,",1000,5857011905,36.577900,19,-79.441100,Correct Craft,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@36.577900,-79.441100,16z",2001,$12500,power, (Danville),2001 87 Ski nautique in AMAZING shape.,https://danville.craigslist.org/boa/5857011905.html,
