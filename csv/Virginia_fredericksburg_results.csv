The boat has all original parts  as when purchased (excepting new stainless steel propeller shaft installed 1997, and a new spare propeller) . All chrome fittings were re-chromed in 1996.  There are no known problems with the hull's structure.  The membrane in the double bottom has deteriorated,  seams have been caulked with oakum and flexible caulk, this needs annual maintenance.  A bilge pump has been installed.  The engine, a six cylinder 95 Hp Continental adapted for ChrisCraft was rebuilt in 1996 by a New Haven, Ct. company specializing in marine engine repair..  There is no log, but time on engine is est. to be less than 300 hours.  All hardware was re-chromed in 1996. People specializing in classic boat  will judge the condition of the boat as good. It needs new varnish and floor covering. Included is original trailer supplied by ChrisCraft.  Needs painting. Last time in water was Nov. 2015,  Engine was running in Nov. 2015 when it was winterized. Could not be started this spring due to old gas. Fuel pump has been  removed and checked out good.
