This boat spent the first 12 years of its life in freshwater lakes of New Mexico. I've had it for three where I've used it in and around the coastal areas in ILM and lakes of VA, cruising/wakeboarding. Each and every use was followed by a proper flush and a wash from keel to topside. You will not find an early 2000s Bow rider in better condition, period. Coastal or inland. The gel coat is professionally waxed and cleaned yearly. The boat never spent the night in the water or outside. The trailer has a breakaway tongue which allows it to stay in my temp controlled garage. See photos. Vinyl is nearly perfect, as is the gel coat. Everything works, the boat is ready for the water. Engine oil and gear oil freshly changed as they are yearly. Brand new battery. Vengeance prop and original are included. Full custom cover in good condition. Bimini top also included.
