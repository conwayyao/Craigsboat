83,,"['37.152990', '-80.578794']",2016-10-27 21:00,"Hello there. I have a early 90's model Cobia boat for sale. The boat has a 4 cylinder inboard engine with a stern drive. The lower unit was replaced several years ago and mechanically the boat ran well several years ago. The boat was winterized and hasn't been taken out for several years. All hydraulics worked well. Some of the dash instruments didn't functions well but the power trim, rpm and others were fine. The boat is 17' i believe. Inside needs a good cleaning. The trailer is a ez load type with rollers and is in very good shape. I was going to do vinyl replacement on the boat seats but never started the project. One really nice fetcher is that the boats interior flooring is fiberglass thus it won't rot or deteriorate like wood. I believe that the carburetor might need some work. I feel that this is a wonderful project boat that's not in need of much to have it ready for the water. I am listing this without a price and accepting offers to see what I can get. I feel that the trailer it's self  is worth between 750 to 1000 dollars but I'll consider any reasonable offer for everything I have related to it. I would also consider a trade on a decent 4 wheeler as well, just let me know what you have. Please put boat in the subject line and I'll respond.
