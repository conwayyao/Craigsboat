She has twin drivers stations and twin Chrysler 360 V-8 with velvet drive transmissions, one of the motors is about 1 year old and one about 5 years old, and both have exhausts that are only approx a year old from front to back, and approx one year on the risers and manifolds. She sounds amazing. I love the power in the sound when both engines are fired up.  However, don't think that means it is too loud to enjoy.  Just the opposite.  You are listening to the sound of two engines that will take you where you want and back with confidence.  (One of my favorite trips is to the dam and anchor off the island and swim out there.  Nice smooth ride all the way!  Very spacious living area carpeted in aft, black accenting window treatments, spacious working kitchen and dinette area (recently re-upholstered to a charming boat themed material for the seatbacks, and a pretty blue for the seat/benches that you simply wipe clean with a cloth; great for wet bottoms or spills) and a comfortable V-bearth with built in armoire that has drawers and closet. Plenty of storage.  The bathroom has a nice size stand up shower, sink and toilet.  (We have never used them b/c the marina has showers/toilets in the poolhouse that is available to all slip renters.  Fabulous perk to staying at this marina.)  This boat is ALL aluminum: the hull, all ribs, railings, entire super structure including the framing for the cabin; the floor joists, the helm station is aluminum except for the beautiful wood interior, which makes this boat virtually maintenance free.  Everything on this boat is very functional and we stay on it every weekend possible, stayed even more so in the winter!  She is easy to keep cool/cold with current A/C systems and easy to heat using one heater in aft area and one in galley.  We took her out for a trip around the lake and did our meals this Christmas on her!  (We like doing the holidays on her.)  She also comes with her own radio/CD sound system which sounds great.  These boats were extremely well built and are well sought after, and at only 12,000 pounds which is about 1/3 the weight of boats this size which means it will give you 30% better fuel economy.  The drivers station up top needs a steering cable.  We never replaced it because we prefer to use the steering wheel from the ""downstairs"" station; very easy to maneuver.  This boat is currently in a slip but will need to be moved as the slip does not go with the boat. Slip availability via marina manager.  Great guy!  And if you are looking for a marina, we highly recommend the one we are at Bayside Marina.  Clean, friendly, and awesome amenities such as a pool (frequented all the time!), tennis courts and basketball.  One of the best rental spots around, especially considering the amazing amenities!  Approx $250/mo for the spot we are in.  At our asking price, you won't find another Marinette anywhere or a better boat of this type. You'll see why you'll want this lady once you board her.  She's a perfect fit for size, fun, convenience of preparing your own meals, watching movies while curled up on the couch, and sunning up top on nice days.   Look at it as owning your own ""water property"" at the lake b/c it truly is like living in an apartment on the water.  Can't beat that!  (Just took it out for our Thanksgiving Day Tour of SML.)
