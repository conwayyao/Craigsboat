39,good,,2016-11-24 16:54,"This is a 1954 Johnson 5.5 hp outboard with fuel tank for sale.  It is an older one for sure but it is in great mechanical condition.  It has just been serviced by an exert marine mechanic who has 40 years of experience.  He rebuilt the carb, cleaned the points, serviced the lower unit and also installed new spark plugs and a new pull rope.  It cranks up easy, has good even compression, idles low, has a strong flow of water from the water pump and runs strong at the top end too.  It comes with a good clean dual line (air and fuel) OMC pressure tank. This is a dependable little motor that is a great size for a jon boat that won't break the bank or your budget.  In case you are wondering, parts are still readily available for these motors. The cash only price is firm @ $450.  I will take $350 for just the motor if you don't need the fuel tank. NO checks and NO emails. Contact me by phone or text only at the number listed above between 8:00 am and 9:00 pm.
