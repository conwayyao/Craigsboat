You can hear the motor try to start but won't turn over. I'm not sure what it needs but in amazing shape. The trailer is a double jetski trailer with good bunks. It has new lights and good to go. If you are interested email me for pictures. I don't think it would take anyone who knows what they are doing to fix these. The trailer and 1997 ski is worth a lot more. I think this is fair.
