0,good,,2016-12-18 10:49,This has been my summer project. I've poured alot of love into her making her beautiful again. Here is what has been done to her.. -new starter -new solenoids -new fuel lines -new fuel filter -new water/fuel separator -plywood floor sealed -new marine grade carpet -new fold out lounge seats from overtons (only one shown in pic) -custom upholstery job in bow done by professional -entire bow has brand new marine grade treated plywood -rebuilt carb -new battery -new cover -low range GPS unit I'm sure I'm forgetting a few things here and there. I had her on the water at the end of this summer and she was lake worthy. Carb is a little finicky warming up but she ran all day for me. Project is right around 85-90% full restore.  A few projects here and there all cosmetic. Nothing that keeps it from running.  She has just been winterized so she is ready for the winter. Motor is a 5 liter Chevy V8 paired to an OMC outdrive.  Internals completely rebuilt by previous owner. My price is OBO. Feel free to shoot me an offer. Text probably works best but I'll answer calls when I can.,,5896877788,,20,,Bayliner,,Bowrider,$3700,power, (Stephens City),1989 Bayliner Bowrider,https://winchester.craigslist.org/boa/5896877788.html,1989
