It is moored at Friday Harbor right now, but will be hauled out in Bellingham in March. A permit lease can be arranged if needed. F/V Satisfaction 32'x11.5'x2.5' Fiberglass hull (with tunnel) built by Uniflite in 1980. This boat was built for Bristol Bay but instead fished Puget Sound. The bowthruster was installed 2007. 300 hp diesel Cummins 555 with Twin Disc 506 gear. Very reliable and burns 5 gph at 8kts. Keel cooled so there is not raw water interaction between the sea and the engine, and you can run the engine no problem when it is hauled out. Hydraulic 8-inch Bowthruster with controls at all three stations. This bowthruster has gotten me out of any tangle I managed to get myself into! Works great. Hatches will hold 10k pounds, but 6k organized in brailers. There is an insulated watertight brailer for the center hatch, and two slush bags (one on each side), plus brailers. Hydraulics are very strong, and the bulletproof Easthope drum drive has a high and low speed so it can really crank it in when it needs to pull. Levelwind works great with no quirks, and the sternroller can power in and out, if desired. Mast and boom with 2,000-pound electric winch. Electronics include GPS, VHF, radar, 2 sounders and AC shore power w/ battery charger. Galley is comfortable with a big table and a Dickinson ""Bristol"" oil stove. Running water and a sink. Two bunks down below, plus a head; there is a holding tank (but it has never been used) or a direct overboard. This is a great fishing boat that maneuvers very well and handles the sea just fine. The low price is because the engine is tired and the back deck could use an overhaul. I would have kept fishing this boat but I just bought a larger and faster boat that will better suit my needs (I process much of my own catch).

For sale separately or together. Who needs a double when you can catamaran two single kayaks side-by-side. Just use a pair of EasyRider outrigger poles to connect the two kayaks firmly together. Takes less than a minute to connect the kayaks. Easy Rider Eskimo kayaks are the only kayaks in the world that come with this option. And since its so easy to attach the kayaks, switch between being two singles and being a catamaran whenever you want. The Eskimo 17 is one of the Lightest Fastest, Strongest-Built Kayaks in the World. EasyRider Eskimo Kayaks are the only kayaks in the world that are factory-built to easily plug in a suite of fun accessories. Easily plug in an Outrigger and/or a fast Batwing Sail. Or use the outrigger poles to connect two single Easy Rider Eskimo kayaks together side-by-side catamaran-style ! Plug in a sail and the pair of kayaks sails like a true catamaran. Clip on an Easy Rider Tarpaulin between the outrigger poles for a Hobe-style mesh platform above the waves, and let your dog ride beside you on the tarpaulin as you paddle down the beach. You can even attach a 2hp outboard motor or electric motor to one of the outrigger poles, and presto you have a way to quickly make long crossings or travel against the wind! And much more! Buying an Easy Rider Eskimo 17 opens a world of possibilities that no other kayak in the world can offer. The Eskimo 17 weighs in at a super-light 49 lbs. And it's trimmed with all the extras ! : - EasyRider's patented Self-Centering Rudder System allows you to steer true in any conditions. No more weaving back and forth !

And the outrigger has almost no drag, so you go just as fast. Note- We have a 5-ft Easy Rider Outrigger we're selling separately, including outrigger poles, for $495.
