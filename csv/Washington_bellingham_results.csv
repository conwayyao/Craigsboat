These kayaks are made in Vancouver, BC and are designed to be taken apart and put in a bag/backpack and checked as luggage on an airplane. This is a 1999 kayak with the hypalon hull and a cordura fabric deck. There is a rudder and bow and stern hatches. This is a well traveled and well loved kayak, but is sound and ready for more adventures and will last years and years. It has normal wear and tear, but nothing that has affected the integrity of the hull or the deck. In fact, we just took it to Greenland in August! It has been upgraded with the newer built-in coaming - if you are considering an older Feathercraft with the fiberglass combing you should know you can't get replacements for it any more. The new built-in coaming removes the worry of it breaking during travel or use. It has always been washed immediately after use, and the aluminum poles have always been treated with Bo-shield whenever it was constructed or deconstructed. The deck was treated several years ago with scotch-guard and seam-sealer, but it could probably use another treatment. The kayak comes with a brand new sea sock, an almost new spray skirt, a paddle if you want it, and a travel backpack. There are a few scratches on the hull (nothing piercing the hull) and a few abrasions on the deck, all treated with aquaseal.
