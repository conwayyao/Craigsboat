At Sanger Boats, craftsmanship is still an art. We still build our wakeboard boats and ski boats with precision and care, one at a time. Every one of our limited production masterpieces take shape in our ten acre facility in the heart of California's central valley. The climate in this area has proven to be the perfect blend of heat and humidity for producing the world's finest boats. Each boat is rigged by one individual. This ensures that no function was missed, unlike mass production facilities. Almost all of our small parts are built under one roof, to ensure that you receive the best quality that money can buy. Little details like through-bolted motor mounts and bilge pumps that are mounted to aluminum plates ensure the manufacturing integrity. These are just a few samples of our quality that separates Sanger Boats apart from the competition. You won't find us spending big bucks in expensive magazines or sponsoring high-price athletes to gain market share. We depend on the thousands of satisfied customers and our reputation, thus saving you thousands of dollars and allowing us to focus on what we do best, building the best quality boats for an affordable price.

At Sanger Boats, craftsmanship is still an art. We still build our wakeboard boats and ski boats with precision and care, one at a time. Every one of our limited production masterpieces take shape in our ten acre facility in the heart of California's central valley. The climate in this area has proven to be the perfect blend of heat and humidity for producing the world's finest boats. Each boat is rigged by one individual. This ensures that no function was missed, unlike mass production facilities. Almost all of our small parts are built under one roof, to ensure that you receive the best quality that money can buy. Little details like through-bolted motor mounts and bilge pumps that are mounted to aluminum plates ensure the manufacturing integrity. These are just a few samples of our quality that separates Sanger Boats apart from the competition. You won't find us spending big bucks in expensive magazines or sponsoring high-price athletes to gain market share.

Was entirely rebuilt in 2012, brand new oil system and all new ignition coils last fall. New starter and wiring harness this year as well and new lower unit bearings. This motor runs flawlessly and has an ass load of power. It's on my 23' willie predator at the moment and will do 47 mph with a jet! That's flat out hauling ass. It has  handled every load I have put in my boat. 8 people and gear up on plane and cruised at 35 no problem. This is an XL shaft was originally on an alumaweld. But I put it on a jack plate and it works fine. Jack plate is optional to go with motor but haven't decided yet. Not in any hurry to sell as for my Yamaha won't be rebuilt for a month or so. But wanted to give someone the chance to run the motor while on my boat. Only going back to my Yamaha because I have a prop lower unit for it and I can store it under my carport with the other motor on it. The merc is too tall it would hit the roof rafters. Comes with oil tank as well.i am unable to check email so text or call only plz. show contact info $5200 obo",150,5917761208,46.061400,23,-118.331500,Mercury,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@46.061400,-118.331500,16z",Saltwater,$5200,power, (Walla walla),225 mercury tiller outboard,https://kpr.craigslist.org/boa/5917761208.html,2000

At Sanger Boats, craftsmanship is still an art. We still build our wakeboard boats and ski boats with precision and care, one at a time. Every one of our limited production masterpieces take shape in our ten acre facility in the heart of California's central valley. The climate in this area has proven to be the perfect blend of heat and humidity for producing the world's finest boats. Each boat is rigged by one individual. This ensures that no function was missed, unlike mass production facilities. Almost all of our small parts are built under one roof, to ensure that you receive the best quality that money can buy. Little details like through-bolted motor mounts and bilge pumps that are mounted to aluminum plates ensure the manufacturing integrity. These are just a few samples of our quality that separates Sanger Boats apart from the competition. You won't find us spending big bucks in expensive magazines or sponsoring high-price athletes to gain market share. We depend on the thousands of satisfied customers and our reputation, thus saving you thousands of dollars and allowing us to focus on what we do best, building the best quality boats for an affordable price.
