Has a ton of power much more than the 200 Yamaha jet I had before this engine. Not sure on hours. I'd say 150 on rebuild. This motor has had much work done to it in the past few years. Was entirely rebuilt in 2012, brand new oil system and all new ignition coils last fall. New starter and wiring harness this year as well and new lower unit bearings. This motor runs flawlessly and has an ass load of power. It's on my 23' willie predator at the moment and will do 47 mph with a jet! That's flat out hauling ass. It has  handled every load I have put in my boat. 8 people and gear up on plane and cruised at 35 no problem. This is an XL shaft was originally on an alumaweld. But I put it on a jack plate and it works fine. Jack plate is optional to go with motor but haven't decided yet. Not in any hurry to sell as for my Yamaha won't be rebuilt for a month or so. But wanted to give someone the chance to run the motor while on my boat. Only going back to my Yamaha because I have a prop lower unit for it and I can store it under my carport with the other motor on it. The merc is too tall it would hit the roof rafters.
