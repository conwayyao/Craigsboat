1,new,,2016-12-11 14:47,"This is brand new in boxes FROM MANUFACTURER  $1,432 retail asking $700 obo As much as I would love to keep this, I need Christmas and bill money, My loss your gain. Tackle your adventures in tandem. The 380x is made to be ridden by one or two persons. Now you can do what others only dream of with our most versatile kayak series ever! Designed to tackle whitewater, open-water, and now down-wind sailing! Large enough for two but small enough for one! The 380x does it all! When the 16 rapid self-bailing drain valves are open, you are sure to drain off water as quickly as it enters! With the drain valves closed you are certain to remain high and dry when paddling on flat waters such as lakes, bays and other bodies of water. The unique modular design of the Sea Eagle Explorer features a super rigid, high pressure, drop stitch floor that sits on top of an outside floor. This has several advantages. The high pressure DS floor provides great rigidity and super responsive paddling performance. The reinforced outside fabric floor provides a double layer of added protection so it can bounce off rocks, logs and other objects you may hit in whitewater. The Sea Eagle 380x Explorer inflatable kayak is as tough as nails and as rugged as the men and women who ride in it. A handy mid-size kayak that holds two to three people and up to 750 pounds, the 380x lets you rocket fearlessly down Class IV rapids, traverse miles of wilderness rivers to remote camping spots, or fly fish on trout streams that other fishermen can't access. Even better for travelers, the kayak deflates and stores in a handy carrying bag, so you easily haul it along on a small plane to impossibly obscure fishing or camping sites. There's no better kayak for true adventurers than the Sea Eagle 380x. Unlike ordinary ""dry-only"" kayaks with no drains or ""wet-only"" kayaks with permanently open drains, the 380x offers four extra-large, easily convertible drains for both wet and dry conditions. When the drains are open, the craft bails itself in rough whitewater or ocean conditions. When the drains are closed, they won't let a drop of water in, keeping both you and your cargo comfortably dry in calm water. And even in the worst-case scenario--when your kayak is filled to the gunwales with water--the 380x still floats. The 380x Explorer owes its durability to 1,000-denier, polyester-supported, high-pressure fabric with quadruple-thickness electronic-welded seams. How tough is the Explorer? In torture testing, Sea Eagle pounded it mercilessly with the claw of a claw hammer to no effect. Stabbing it with a screwdriver also had a negligible impact. The ""crocodile hide"" hull is so sturdy that it can stand up to almost any challenge, let alone a few bumps from the dock. Other details include integrated bow and stern spray skirts with water-deflecting guards; rope lacing that forms secure handholds and convenient tie-down points; two inflatable kayak seats; two 8-foot double-ended paddles; a foot pump; and a repair kit. The 380x Explorer measures 150 by 37 inches (W x L) and weighs 47 pounds. It's also backed by a three-year warranty.
