Nice home + coastal cruiser; We presently are painting + sanding to protect from weather. If buy you can continue to cherry out to your liking. It will be sold `As Is. Needs a depth sounder, this one partially works + needs an antenna for an older model gps, that you may want to replace if want to add more bells + whistles. Their is also a small hand help gps. As far as other electronics like radar, chart plotters, you may want to choose for your self, for we do not use them. Sails are in good shape, main a little stretched but good + 2nd stay sail fairly new, used a few times. Windows are dull on one side of boat w/bronze + opens + could be replaced, other side just glass does not open. If want to cherry out boat for your liking, it will be a great boat. The boat is well worth your effort to make it yours. House over entrance could be redone with board similar to hull if wanted to retain tradition. We did with plywood, epoxy + paint. Nice for wind + sun. Presently making few repairs w/epoxy + painting. Simple design but choice of wood is nice with traditional shape. Wood is from locally grown woods found in central to southern coast of Oregon. Built in Coos Bay, Or. Launched in 1988. Wood includes Port orford cedar mostly, Douglas fir, Pacific yew, Yellow cedar, White oak. Topsides decking are cotton caulked. Decking laid Douglas fir old growth with galvanized steel wood screw fastenings. Ceiling 1/2"" thick yellow cedar fastened down with steel nails. Concrete keel encased in case hardened steel with 1"" diameter galvanized steel bolts. Tractor tread steel pins inside extended seats, to have more weight for volume. Equal 1 1/2 ton of pig iron lead ingots. More weight was added to provide more stability for the aluminum mast which is 7 taller then the original wooden mast. Herringbone chime wood construction. Keel w/cement + wood shoe. Original owner Elmer Atkins was a forest worker in Oregon selected each board. Built it for 10 years died right after finished 1988. 56"" head room in cabin, v birth has nice raised hatch, with wood vents or clear plastic. As well back entry hatch. Does not have a head. Aluminum, mfg Le Fiell mast is 7 taller then original wood that broke. Boom is solid douglas fir. rigged as a Bermuda Cutter. A. Lam, Hong King dacron 590 working sail plus new stay sail. Standing rigging 1 x 19 stainless steel, NaviTec 316 turnbuckles, ss 1/4 x 1 1/2"" chain plates. Ss back stays, Schaefer deck hardware. 3 Harken 8 halyard winches, 4 bronze Southcoast sheet winches. Engine is a westerbeke diesel, model M-40, 4 cylinder, 2 racor filters. aprox 1900 hours. We do 4-5 knts conservatively, but easily can do 7. The last owner pulled 8 logs + replaced original smaller motor. Runs great. Only major negative of this boat is the location of the 30 gallon diesel stainless tank, which would be a major job to get it out, if needed. When our fuel lines got clogged we think due to bio-cide breaking up pieces or perhaps Mexican fuel big seas churning the fuel. We resolved by putting a line to cockpit to switch if be in similar condition + unable to easily empty out tank. We do have 2 filters + now can also have option to go directly into a 5 gallon jug of clean fuel in cockpit. Which is great back up. We carry external jugs of fuel also. 12 + 19 gallon water tank, simple piping for faucet with foot switch manual pump. Sleep; 40 inch bed to side in v birth, clothes cabinet + large shelf. A nice very large metal vent mushroom can be put on from top deck for v birth. In second only other room as galley, beside chain locker is another single seat for bunk + a small seat, which both have been extended from a normal size bench, to add the tractor tread steel pins as weight for ballast. Making seats comfortable, + extra wide. Also for passage can lay bunk across both benches for a bunk that would block off v birth. Bunk has opening to chain locker with hydraulics for capstan 175 - 5/16 chain gal, 160 -3/4 polyester line for 33 lb bruce anchor 100 nylon line 50 - 5/16 chain gal for 15 lb danforth.

Feel free to contact me with questions and I can answer them to the best of my ability. This fall, a friend of mine from UW asked me if I wanted a boat. He lives in Seattle and, as you would expect, doesn't have space for a boat. He was keeping it at another friend's house but I assume that his desire to tinker with the boat fizzled out and the friend wanted his drive way back. Long story short, I ended up with the boat here in Shelton. Currently, I have the title for the boat and have not tried to clean it up or anything since I already have roughly a decade's worth of projects on the list. The reason for sale is that my dad owns a boat and we do not need two unused boats between the two of us. This boat has a mer cruiser 228 engine and drive unit along with a fresh water heat exchanger. The boat was functional this summer according to my friend. I know next to nothing about boats, but my dad is familiar with Sea Rays and Mer Cruisers. Between the two of us, we should be able to answer any questions. Feel free to text, call, or email me in regards to the boat/trailer/engine/drive unit.

Needs a depth sounder, this one partially works + needs an antenna for an older model gps, that you may want to replace if want to add more bells + whistles. Their is also a small hand help gps. As far as other electronics like radar, chart plotters, you may want to choose for your self, for we do not use them. Sails are in good shape, main a little stretched but good + 2nd stay sail fairly new, used a few times. Windows are dull on one side of boat w/bronze + opens + could be replaced, other side just glass does not open. If want to cherry out boat for your liking, it will be a great boat. The boat is well worth your effort to make it yours. House over entrance could be redone with board similar to hull if wanted to retain tradition. We did with plywood, epoxy + paint. Nice for wind + sun. Presently making few repairs w/epoxy + painting. Simple design but choice of wood is nice with traditional shape. Wood is from locally grown woods found in central to southern coast of Oregon. Built in Coos Bay, Or. Launched in 1988. Wood includes Port orford cedar mostly, Douglas fir, Pacific yew, Yellow cedar, White oak. Topsides decking are cotton caulked. Decking laid Douglas fir old growth with galvanized steel wood screw fastenings. Ceiling 1/2"" thick yellow cedar fastened down with steel nails. Concrete keel encased in case hardened steel with 1"" diameter galvanized steel bolts. Tractor tread steel pins inside extended seats, to have more weight for volume. Equal 1 1/2 ton of pig iron lead ingots. More weight was added to provide more stability for the aluminum mast which is 7 taller then the original wooden mast. Herringbone chime wood construction. Keel w/cement + wood shoe. Original owner Elmer Atkins was a forest worker in Oregon selected each board. Built it for 10 years died right after finished 1988. 56"" head room in cabin, v birth has nice raised hatch, with wood vents or clear plastic. As well back entry hatch. Does not have a head.

Engine is a westerbeke diesel, model M-40, 4 cylinder, 2 racor filters. aprox 1900 hours. We do 4-5 knts conservatively, but easily can do 7. The last owner pulled 8 logs + replaced original smaller motor. Runs great. Only major negative of this boat is the location of the 30 gallon diesel stainless tank, which would be a major job to get it out, if needed. When our fuel lines got clogged we think due to bio-cide breaking up pieces or perhaps Mexican fuel big seas churning the fuel. We resolved by putting a line to cockpit to switch if be in similar condition + unable to easily empty out tank. We do have 2 filters + now can also have option to go directly into a 5 gallon jug of clean fuel in cockpit. Which is great back up. We carry external jugs of fuel also. 12 + 19 gallon water tank, simple piping for faucet with foot switch manual pump. Sleep; 40 inch bed to side in v birth, clothes cabinet + large shelf.

Making seats comfortable, + extra wide. Also for passage can lay bunk across both benches for a bunk that would block off v birth.
