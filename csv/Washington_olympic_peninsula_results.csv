Like the first 13-foot Whaler hull introduced in 1958, the Sport features ""unsinkable"" Unibond construction and a twin sponson hull for lateral stability and superior performance."" Your opportunity to own a legend. Whalers are second to none, and have a reputation for being the Mercedes of runabouts. They are very high quality, unsinkable and are one of the few boats on the market that actually appreciate -- protecting your investment. This boat has been used very lightly and is in excellent condition, save for a couple of minor dings in the gelcoat. The upholstery on the seats are also showing some wear. It is fast, extremely stable, and did I say unsinkable? Check out the online videos of the manufacturer driving one of these after they sawed it in half. Great peace of mind when you have your family out on the water. The 40hp Mercury outboard, also in excellent condition, has plenty of power to water ski, pull the tube, or whatever. The boat weighs less than 1,000 pounds and pulls really well behind my Ford Ranger 4cyl. It comes with a 2001 EZ Loader galvanized trailer, bimini top, and full length stainless steel side rails. Also included are bow and seat cushions (shown in featured photo). It is suitable for sport or fishing.

Nice home + coastal cruiser; We presently are painting + sanding to protect from weather. If buy you can continue to cherry out to your liking. It will be sold `As Is. Needs a depth sounder, this one partially works + needs an antenna for an older model gps, that you may want to replace if want to add more bells + whistles. Their is also a small hand help gps. As far as other electronics like radar, chart plotters, you may want to choose for your self, for we do not use them. Sails are in good shape, main a little stretched but good + 2nd stay sail fairly new, used a few times. Windows are dull on one side of boat w/bronze + opens + could be replaced, other side just glass does not open. If want to cherry out boat for your liking, it will be a great boat. The boat is well worth your effort to make it yours. House over entrance could be redone with board similar to hull if wanted to retain tradition. We did with plywood, epoxy + paint. Nice for wind + sun. Presently making few repairs w/epoxy + painting. Simple design but choice of wood is nice with traditional shape. Wood is from locally grown woods found in central to southern coast of Oregon. Built in Coos Bay, Or. Launched in 1988. Wood includes Port orford cedar mostly, Douglas fir, Pacific yew, Yellow cedar, White oak. Topsides decking are cotton caulked. Decking laid Douglas fir old growth with galvanized steel wood screw fastenings. Ceiling 1/2"" thick yellow cedar fastened down with steel nails. Concrete keel encased in case hardened steel with 1"" diameter galvanized steel bolts. Tractor tread steel pins inside extended seats, to have more weight for volume. Equal 1 1/2 ton of pig iron lead ingots. More weight was added to provide more stability for the aluminum mast which is 7 taller then the original wooden mast. Herringbone chime wood construction. Keel w/cement + wood shoe. Original owner Elmer Atkins was a forest worker in Oregon selected each board. Built it for 10 years died right after finished 1988. 56"" head room in cabin, v birth has nice raised hatch, with wood vents or clear plastic. As well back entry hatch. Does not have a head.

Engine is a westerbeke diesel, model M-40, 4 cylinder, 2 racor filters. aprox 1900 hours. We do 4-5 knts conservatively, but easily can do 7. The last owner pulled 8 logs + replaced original smaller motor. Runs great. Only major negative of this boat is the location of the 30 gallon diesel stainless tank, which would be a major job to get it out, if needed. When our fuel lines got clogged we think due to bio-cide breaking up pieces or perhaps Mexican fuel big seas churning the fuel. We resolved by putting a line to cockpit to switch if be in similar condition + unable to easily empty out tank. We do have 2 filters + now can also have option to go directly into a 5 gallon jug of clean fuel in cockpit. Which is great back up. We carry external jugs of fuel also. 12 + 19 gallon water tank, simple piping for faucet with foot switch manual pump. Sleep; 40 inch bed to side in v birth, clothes cabinet + large shelf.

I saved her from the wrecker about a year ago and my hope's are to have someone actually start some work on her. I'd say she's in the best town in Washington to get it done. I just don't have the downtime to even think about it. Twin Chrysler Poly 318 gas engines. Probably not re-buildable unless you wanted to do the poly 402ci stroker kit and punch it out. Most would say go diesel. There's a large swim deck platform comes with the boat. 99% original interior, all hardware comes with it. Two unique copper water tanks located on the flybridge meant to gravity feed, mainly the head.

Partial transom replacement performed by the Port Townsend Shipwright's Co-Op, were the boat sat on the hard the past 4 years from the previous owner.

Needs a depth sounder, this one partially works + needs an antenna for an older model gps, that you may want to replace if want to add more bells + whistles. Their is also a small hand help gps. As far as other electronics like radar, chart plotters, you may want to choose for your self, for we do not use them. Sails are in good shape, main a little stretched but good + 2nd stay sail fairly new, used a few times. Windows are dull on one side of boat w/bronze + opens + could be replaced, other side just glass does not open. If want to cherry out boat for your liking, it will be a great boat. The boat is well worth your effort to make it yours. House over entrance could be redone with board similar to hull if wanted to retain tradition. We did with plywood, epoxy + paint. Nice for wind + sun. Presently making few repairs w/epoxy + painting. Simple design but choice of wood is nice with traditional shape. Wood is from locally grown woods found in central to southern coast of Oregon. Built in Coos Bay, Or. Launched in 1988. Wood includes Port orford cedar mostly, Douglas fir, Pacific yew, Yellow cedar, White oak. Topsides decking are cotton caulked. Decking laid Douglas fir old growth with galvanized steel wood screw fastenings. Ceiling 1/2"" thick yellow cedar fastened down with steel nails. Concrete keel encased in case hardened steel with 1"" diameter galvanized steel bolts. Tractor tread steel pins inside extended seats, to have more weight for volume. Equal 1 1/2 ton of pig iron lead ingots. More weight was added to provide more stability for the aluminum mast which is 7 taller then the original wooden mast. Herringbone chime wood construction. Keel w/cement + wood shoe. Original owner Elmer Atkins was a forest worker in Oregon selected each board. Built it for 10 years died right after finished 1988. 56"" head room in cabin, v birth has nice raised hatch, with wood vents or clear plastic. As well back entry hatch. Does not have a head.

Engine is a westerbeke diesel, model M-40, 4 cylinder, 2 racor filters. aprox 1900 hours. We do 4-5 knts conservatively, but easily can do 7. The last owner pulled 8 logs + replaced original smaller motor. Runs great. Only major negative of this boat is the location of the 30 gallon diesel stainless tank, which would be a major job to get it out, if needed. When our fuel lines got clogged we think due to bio-cide breaking up pieces or perhaps Mexican fuel big seas churning the fuel. We resolved by putting a line to cockpit to switch if be in similar condition + unable to easily empty out tank. We do have 2 filters + now can also have option to go directly into a 5 gallon jug of clean fuel in cockpit. Which is great back up. We carry external jugs of fuel also. 12 + 19 gallon water tank, simple piping for faucet with foot switch manual pump. Sleep; 40 inch bed to side in v birth, clothes cabinet + large shelf.

75,good,[],2016-11-13 10:52,"1983 Bayliner Trophy in great condition. Volvo Penta 260A I/O with 312 Hours and new exhaust manifolds, elbows, gaskets, and starter installed July 2016. The boat was bottom painted  July 2016. The kicker is a 2014 Yamaha Model T9.9LPB, high thrust, long shaft with very low hours as this boat hasn't been fished much. The warranty is good until 5/18/2017. Brand new lift assist bracket. Recent work includes water pump, all wiring and batteries. The boat has a new 30 Amp shore power cord in the box, comes with trim tabs, VHF radio with new antenna, porta potty, anchor and ground tackle and misc gear. The boat comes with a custom marine grade canvas cockpit canopy that has six clear zip removable or roll up windows. The canopy completely encloses the cockpit and creates a separate room, protected from the elements. With the windows removed, it can store either forward or aft, or just be used as a sun shade. No GPS but does have a fish finder. The boat cruises easily with 6 adults at 25 knots, and tops out about 30-35 knots. The interior is in great shape with no rips or stains. The forward V-Berth can sleep 3 adults separately - one on the lower portion, one on the upper, and one in the quarter berth that goes underneath the dinette. The stove does not work, but we have a single burner butane stove in there that works great. The sink hand pump also does not work. Trailer is a tandem axle painted steel trailer with new break lines, hubs, drums, bearings and pads professionally installed. It is missing the wheel fenders, but are new, but haven't had them installed yet. The tires with spare have about 80% to 85% tread remaining. The boat has been professionally winterized and is being stored on the hard at Hilton Harbor, which provides an almost on demand launching/hauling service 7 days a week during the summer. The price is comparable to keeping it at Squalicum Harbor Marina in Bellingham. I kept the boat there last summer, moorage was about $220 a month (month to month rent with only a 15 day cancellation notice needed) and I was able to secure a slip as late as June. Both options makes using the boat incredibly easy especially if you don't own a rig large enough to tow.

There was a limited production of only 75 boats built in Missoula, MT, including this one. This boat sailed Flathead Lake, MT for years, before the previous owner recognized this boat and drove all the way from Seattle, where he is president of a racing yacht club, to purchase it for his father. His father sailed it on Lake Coeur d'Alene before downsizing his fleet and selling it to us. He was sad to see it go, but it has been the perfect boat for us to learn to sail. We're only parting with it now as we are relocating. Boat is in Sequim. Please call or email with questions or to take a look. Thanks and happy sailing!
