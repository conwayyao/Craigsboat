Other hull design features unique to the Sun runners were the use of encapsulated stringers in the hull so virtually no rot. The hull is the strongest toughest design ever mass produced and was warrantied for life.    Turns on a dime and powers out of the hole briskly with the dual props and the 5.0 V8 engine. It gets buffed and hand rubbed twice a year and is kept inside. Factory bow cover is serviceable but needs some repair, the salon cover was repaired last year with new window panels and some stich work. The rear cover is good. With the covers on it can handle rough water and rainy days too. Trailer is nice and has new winch strap and new tires. Launches and recovers like a dream even in the wind. Needs some little things just like any boat 25 years old. That's part of the fun.
