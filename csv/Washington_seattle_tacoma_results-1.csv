Anytime Friday but it must be Friday. Boat is in ROUGH condition.  I think it was licensed in 2005.  I have the title. The trailer will NOT be towable.  Wheel's are flat, not fixable, and rusted through the rims.  Will not tow.  Also the trailer is not licensed and I do not have the title. You MUST have another trailer or a flatbed. This is a project and or the piece of straw that breaks your marriage and starts your divorce. Floor and interior walls need replacing.  If it was me, (and I don't know what I'm doing), I'd pull floor and sides, coat the inside with some truck bed liner for head and noise insulation, then closed cell foam the inside for positive flotation, and put new exterior grade plywood in it.  That'd make a safeish lake boat out of it. The transom may actually be good.  It looks like they welded a heavy aluminum plate transom over the 1"" thick (or possibly 2x1"") plywood.  It had my wife on it so I could lift the tongue. No holes, not enough inspection for corrosion.  It is painted and superficially looks fine.  I have no way to garantee it's state.

The 230 Wake we tested took full advantage of the optional 430-hp Twin Rotax 4-TEC engines installed. Onboard there is room for 12 people or up to 2000 lbs of people and gear. You will always have the perfect wake by controlling up to 1000 lbs of ballast water and PerfectPass WakeboardPro speed control. There is plenty of room to stow your wakeboards onboard the twin racks on the standard tower and when you are done for the day you can stow your boat on the standard tandem axle trailer with disc brakes.

Cleats are pull-up stainless steel and bow rails are low-profile and easy to reach. Seating in the bow is tremendous. At least six can comfortably gather up front. Large marine speakers deliver the tunes to the bow and lighted inset drinkholders with mirrors at the back are on both sides. Lift the seats up and you find a neat system for protecting gear stored inside. A rubberized grass mat system allows any water to drain down to the bottom and away while softening the bumps as you ride along. Under your feet, snap-in carpet softens the floor and makes clean up a snap at the end of the day. Three filler cushions convert the front into a spacious tanning salon. Stepping on back you find the first major surprise on the 230 Wake; a fold and stow retractable windscreen with door in the walkthrough. This pocket door system simply pulls out of the driver's side pod. You flip up the window and lock it in place, then lock the entire door in place with a barrel latch. Another great feature about this system is that it is all tempered glass so you have a truly open feeling looking forward while blocking the chilly morning breeze from the main cockpit.At the Controls The companion and driver's seats are comfortable bucket style with swivel and slide adjustments, to keep you in the conversation and give you a clear view ahead. Speakers to the sides of both seats provide loud, crisp sound to the main cockpit. A sturdy stainless grab bar gives the rider more confidence until they get used to the power of the optional 430hp supercharged engine package. The two boxes in the companion station house the stereo head, 12-volt adaptor and tons of room for bottles of tanning lotions, wallets and more. In the floor between the seats is a huge locker that has a rubber pad to protect the skis and any other long items you need to stow, or to keep the life jacket kit in easy reach. The helm station is laid out well for easy visibility of all instruments. With the Infinity sound system, you have a great PA system with the mic mounted to the left of the wheel for easy reach of the driver. In the middle of the instruments is the Perfect Pass system with 8 memory set points. Split throttle and shift levers are on the side gunnel with a padded arm rest with drinkholder just below. The controls for the ballast tanks are just below the armrest on the side panel. Our test model had another great option, electric retractable windows to really open up the feel underway. Push a button and the windows come down or go back up just like in your car. Overhead is a great wakeboard tower with tow point, racks and room to mount the Infinity sound systemCockpit Layout Moving on back, the aft cockpit offers another huge sitting space with wrap-around seating benches. Under the starboard bench is a handy carry-on Igloo cooler for drinks and beverages. Over on the port side is another padded storage box. The sunpad on the back covers the engine box. A standard pull-up ski post easily pulls out of the back of the stern bench seat for standard skiing. Under the pad, the table is stowed making it easy to find and easy to set up. The stern light stows in clips in the fiberglass tray that lifts out to gain access to the engines. With the engine cover down, the sunpad makes a great place to hang out at anchor, sit comfortably to put your skis or wakeboard on, or just relax and watch a sunset. Across the back are numerous handholds to get back aboard as well as a concealed telescoping swim ladder. The integrated swim platform also has a padded top to protect your favorite boards while you get set up for fun. The 230 Wake delivers the type of agility and control you need for boarding tricks. For performance, versatility, and precision this 230 represents a solid overall family package.",80,5918320375,47.862000,24,-122.253200,Brp/seadoo,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@47.862000,-122.253200,16z",230 wake,$31000,power, (Lynnwood),2008 seadoo 230 wake,https://seattle.craigslist.org/sno/boa/5918320375.html,2008
