They both came from a buddy of mine who has invested a ton of money into the '63. That has two rebuilt 283's and a lot of fresh work in it. The '64 is probably a parts boat. I have a little more than $3K invested in them and would just like to get out of it at this point. My knowledge of boats is limited, but I do know that these old classics are gorgeous and extremely valuable when done right. The '63 has been done perfectly up to this point (with pretty much everything to go with it for finishing the project). It has already had about $21K invested to get it to where it currently is at and yes, I can come up with receipts to prove that. So, like I said...let's see what kind of interest there may be. I am absolutely okay with the barter system also.

We put it in the water this past June for the first time and took it to Vancouver Island for a family fishing trip, it was trailered 500 miles round trip, and we ran it every day for the 5 days our fishing licenses were good. It has run awesome every time we've had it out. It has a Mercruiser 120hp engine with Alpha 1 outdrive and will cruse at 25mph, fully loaded with fishing gear and fuel she'll just hit 30mph at WOT. It rides very well for its age and size, we've been caught in some nasty weather and the high hull sides makes it feel very safe. There was no hour meter so engine hours are unknown, we have put 35hrs on the boat since we first put it in this June.  We have used this boat all summer to fish and crab so there are some minor scuffs here and there from normal usage, the engine has developed an oil leak near the transom and the trim gauge sender has gone out but that's it. I work in the marine industry and what I don't have experience in I was able to have professionals help with. I have well over $10,000 in hardware, electronics and paint in this restoration and well over 1000 man hours of work done. I initially was building this boat to last my wife and I for many years but we found out we really like fishing with the rest of the family and our dogs and there just isn't anywhere near enough room for that in this boat.
