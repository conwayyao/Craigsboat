We originally purchased this as a project boat, but we also bought a farm at the same time and just have had no time to work on it.  We're asking $1500 and we do have the title.  It's got a 350 Merc with a volvo penta outdrive.  It's sitting on a good condition galvanized dual axle trailer that's worth almost as much as what we're asking for the boat and trailer.  The floor was removed on the center line to replace a gas tank and needs to be replaced.  The interior needs some TLC, but it's a good project boat.  I included the best pictures I could get of the interior.  There is a bathroom/ head to the right (where you see the door open) and a bed / cabin is behind the head / shower.  With that floor out these are the best pictures I can get.  We have a replacement fuel tank and a range in the last picture, they are not installed, but are sitting on the chair part of the dinette in the last picture.  Those came with the boat but have not been tested by us.  There is also a manual flush toilet that was thrown in when we bought it that we would include. The previous owner had passed away but we were told by the family that the engine did run, and they did take it out on the water about a year before the guy passed.  That would have been about 4 years ago so I imagine it will need some work before it will run just given the time it's been sitting.  We have never tried to start it.

I have a little more than $3K invested in them and would just like to get out of it at this point. My knowledge of boats is limited, but I do know that these old classics are gorgeous and extremely valuable when done right. The '63 has been done perfectly up to this point (with pretty much everything to go with it for finishing the project). It has already had about $21K invested to get it to where it currently is at and yes, I can come up with receipts to prove that. So, like I said...let's see what kind of interest there may be.

43,excellent,"['48.569111', '-122.511463']",2016-12-07 07:25,"I have spent the last two years restoring this boat, we absolutely love it but quickly realized its too small for our family. We put it in the water this past June for the first time and took it to Vancouver Island for a family fishing trip, it was trailered 500 miles round trip, and we ran it every day for the 5 days our fishing licenses were good. It has run awesome every time we've had it out. It has a Mercruiser 120hp engine with Alpha 1 outdrive and will cruse at 25mph, fully loaded with fishing gear and fuel she'll just hit 30mph at WOT. It rides very well for its age and size, we've been caught in some nasty weather and the high hull sides makes it feel very safe. There was no hour meter so engine hours are unknown, we have put 35hrs on the boat since we first put it in this June.  We have used this boat all summer to fish and crab so there are some minor scuffs here and there from normal usage, the engine has developed an oil leak near the transom and the trim gauge sender has gone out but that's it. I work in the marine industry and what I don't have experience in I was able to have professionals help with. I have well over $10,000 in hardware, electronics and paint in this restoration and well over 1000 man hours of work done. I initially was building this boat to last my wife and I for many years but we found out we really like fishing with the rest of the family and our dogs and there just isn't anywhere near enough room for that in this boat. All reasonable offers considered, no trades. As of June this year: -New transom and floor (stringers are fiberglass) -Entire boat has been painted with Interlux Marine Paint systems. - One heavy epoxy barrier coat followed by 4 coats of primer followed by 4 coats of blue on the hull, two coats of white on top and 4 coats of Interlux Speed Coat hard bottom paint. -All railing on the boat is new and stainless, stainless ratchet mount for antenna as well -All wiring has been replaced with marine grade tinned wire -Dual marine grade batteries -New battery switch, bilge pump and switch, wiper motor, gauges, dash switches, LED navigation lights, and LED interior lights -BlueSea Systems circuit breaker panel for downriggers -Standard Horizon VHF radio -Refurbished Alpha Gen 1 transom assembly with new bellows, seals, gimbal bearing and stainless steel swivel pin (a very common leak point) -Brand new SEI outdrive with new Cobra Fin plaining fin, new trim rams, lines and pump -Engine has new manifold and exhaust elbow -Fresh tune up and carb rebuild, also has been converted to Pertronix electronic ignition (no points) -Brand new hoses and belts -Engine has fresh water cooling with brand new Seakamp heat exchanger -New marine grade starter -4 stroke 7hp Honda kicker with fresh tune up oil and water pump -Scotty electric downriggers with swivel bases, were tuned up at LFS marine in Bellingham and re-spooled with stainless wire. -Garmin Echomap 74dv, bought new in March 2016 -1996 Calkins galvanized trailer -All new bearing and seals with Speedi sleeves and stainless bearing buddies -All new LED taillights, marker lights and wire harness -Brand new galvanized wheels and tires -Brand new winch and strap Email, Call or Text 360 Four,Two,Zero 7008, please leave a message",,5893332629,48.569111,20,-122.511463,Seaswirl,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@48.569111,-122.511463,16z",Rouge,$8000,power, (Bow),Restored 1975 Seaswirl Rouge,https://skagit.craigslist.org/boa/5893332629.html,1975
