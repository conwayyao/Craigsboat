I have the perfect winter project for the wood boat enthusiast! 1968 18' Thompson Sea Lancer with newer(can't recall year right now) trailer in excellent condition. Comes with TWO 1966 Mercury 50hp outboards. You can use one and keep the other as a backup or use them both as twins. I had them both running early in the summer but elected to use another outboard for my other boat they were on. The Thompson is in good shape and needs a little work to be water ready.  The bilge was painted with the modern equivalent of ""red lead"" to discourage any rot/fungus in that area.  The floors are temporarily installed along with the seats. There are side panels(which you hardly ever see with Thompson's) and ""kick"" panels that can be used as patterns or used as is(they're in ok shape). These panels are just leaning against the side in the pics to give an idea how they go/look.  Not pictured are various teak trim pieces that go on the gunwales. They were removed at one point for refinishing and are in excellent condition.  There is also a near perfect replacement windshield frame that only needs a little finishing work.  The windshield on the boat already is original and in pretty good shape.  The replacement was on another Thompson I had that got scrapped. The motor on the boat was hung there and never rigged.  I have original controls for BOTH Mercury's.  Hanging both motors on this boat would look great! I had them both running, one needs a starter which I have. The lower unit needs put back on one of them, which I have. Both have two bladed props. Take a look at the pics and see what you think. This project is mostly a cosmetic project and motor rig. I have several pics if you need more. Boat is located in Ballard. I have titles for boat and trailer. No tabs for either. **EDIT** The second motor is no longer available as I've sold the powerhead. I do have an Evinrude 48 spl(for sale separately) that you can HAVE for free instead of the remaining Merc 500. I've never run the Evinrude but it's all there and I see no reason why it wouldn't run.

I have the perfect winter project for the wood boat enthusiast! 1968 18' Thompson Sea Lancer with newer(can't recall year right now) trailer in excellent condition. Comes with TWO 1966 Mercury 50hp outboards. You can use one and keep the other as a backup or use them both as twins. I had them both running early in the summer but elected to use another outboard for my other boat they were on. The Thompson is in good shape and needs a little work to be water ready.  The bilge was painted with the modern equivalent of ""red lead"" to discourage any rot/fungus in that area.  The floors are temporarily installed along with the seats. There are side panels(which you hardly ever see with Thompson's) and ""kick"" panels that can be used as patterns or used as is(they're in ok shape). These panels are just leaning against the side in the pics to give an idea how they go/look.  Not pictured are various teak trim pieces that go on the gunwales. They were removed at one point for refinishing and are in excellent condition.  There is also a near perfect replacement windshield frame that only needs a little finishing work.  The windshield on the boat already is original and in pretty good shape.  The replacement was on another Thompson I had that got scrapped. The motor on the boat was hung there and never rigged.  I have original controls for BOTH Mercury's.  Hanging both motors on this boat would look great! I had them both running, one needs a starter which I have. The lower unit needs put back on one of them, which I have. Both have two bladed props. Take a look at the pics and see what you think. This project is mostly a cosmetic project and motor rig. I have several pics if you need more. Boat is located in Ballard. I have titles for boat and trailer. No tabs for either. **EDIT** The second motor is no longer available as I've sold the powerhead. I do have an Evinrude 48 spl(for sale separately) that you can HAVE for free instead of the remaining Merc 500. I've never run the Evinrude but it's all there and I see no reason why it wouldn't run.

41,excellent,[],2016-12-19 11:09,"If you've ever ridden the Batman roller coaster at Six Flags, then you have the feel for the acceleration a 510HP Rotax jet-drive provides to Sea-Doo's 230 Wake. Zero to 30 mph in less than five seconds slaps you back in the captain's bucket seat and holds you there like shrink-wrap!. At top speed, the 230 hits speeds greater than 55 mph, and those reclining on the comfortable bow lounges might just want to strap on their sunglasses!. Slow down a little before you throw the helm hard to port or starboard, and you'll witness why so many people appreciate the maneuverability, (and tight little circles) that only Jet boats provide. It's especially important for the quick, (and safe) recovery of your downed skier/s. But Sea-Doo's recreational sleuths know that even with all that power, relaxation on the water is what much of boating is about, so they tricked out the boat with a broad array of comforts. The aft lounge wraps around from stern to port-side, ending in an aft-reclining lounge at the port-side windshield bulkhead. The Wake's sun pad and lay-out are spacious, but what really makes the boat livable, is the generous amount of dry storage under the seats. There is storage under each, and every seat/lounge, and it can accommodate virtually any length gear. Finally, be sure and check out the wakeboard tower, ballast system, and perfect-pass electronic wakeboard/ramp-up/cruise control systems. Combined, these built in features really separate this vessel from many of the lesser competitors! I think this boat is ideal for ""all levels"" of fun-loving wakeboard riders, as well as those that simply want to lay out on the lake, and soak up the Sun while listening to her crystal clear, (on board/Wake Tower) Clarion Marine AM-FM/CD/MP3 Sound System! This boat has ""never"" been in salt water, only operated in fresh water lakes! Always moored in the shelter/protection of a Boat House, and Summer-ized/Winter-ized each, and every Season!...Additional Highlights/Features include (but are not limited too): Brand New Custom Designed Upholstery, Carpet, and a fully Customized Trailer (including a professional paint job, LED lights, diamond plate step-ups, and even brand new Tires with Aluminum Multi-Spoke Wheels)! To add to it's already cool look/appearance, I also had Custom ""Tribal-Tatt"" Graphics added to it! It's a ""Very Rare"" find up in Northern Idaho, and she's ready for some serious fun in the sun! All you have to add, is one of our many beautiful Idaho lakes! If you're a serious buyer, please feel free to email me, and I'll gladly discuss it in detail with you! It's also available, (by appointment) to be shown as well...Thank you very much for looking!

Also comes with two Humminbird fish finders. The GPS/fish finder combo works great. The down imaging finder for the front doesn't read right. I think it needs a new head unit. Lots of storage for rods, life jackets etc. Boat has cover, but it needs a good cleaning also. Overall, this has been and is a great boat, just needs some good, consmetic TLC!

At Sanger Boats, craftsmanship is still an art. We still build our wakeboard boats and ski boats with precision and care, one at a time. Every one of our limited production masterpieces take shape in our ten acre facility in the heart of California's central valley. The climate in this area has proven to be the perfect blend of heat and humidity for producing the world's finest boats. Each boat is rigged by one individual. This ensures that no function was missed, unlike mass production facilities. Almost all of our small parts are built under one roof, to ensure that you receive the best quality that money can buy. Little details like through-bolted motor mounts and bilge pumps that are mounted to aluminum plates ensure the manufacturing integrity. These are just a few samples of our quality that separates Sanger Boats apart from the competition. You won't find us spending big bucks in expensive magazines or sponsoring high-price athletes to gain market share. We depend on the thousands of satisfied customers and our reputation, thus saving you thousands of dollars and allowing us to focus on what we do best, building the best quality boats for an affordable price.
