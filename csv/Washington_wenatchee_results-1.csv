The appeal of the Yukon is based on its design, low cost and excellent value. The Yukon is a versatile canoe that is built to last and has proven itself in rental use and adventure racing across Canada. This canoe gives you a comfortable feeling, both in its roominess and stability. This canoe comes standard with anodized aluminum gunnels, bucket seats, stern footbrace and Kevlar reinforcing in the bow and stern. The Yukon has the capacity to be a good family canoe and is also suited for wilderness tripping. It glides nicely, tracks well and resists being blown around in the wind. In moving water, it is predictable and quick to maneuver. The Yukon's standard colour is white; other Clipper colours are available for an additional charge.

I have the perfect winter project for the wood boat enthusiast! 1968 18' Thompson Sea Lancer with newer(can't recall year right now) trailer in excellent condition. Comes with TWO 1966 Mercury 50hp outboards. You can use one and keep the other as a backup or use them both as twins. I had them both running early in the summer but elected to use another outboard for my other boat they were on. The Thompson is in good shape and needs a little work to be water ready.  The bilge was painted with the modern equivalent of ""red lead"" to discourage any rot/fungus in that area.  The floors are temporarily installed along with the seats. There are side panels(which you hardly ever see with Thompson's) and ""kick"" panels that can be used as patterns or used as is(they're in ok shape). These panels are just leaning against the side in the pics to give an idea how they go/look.  Not pictured are various teak trim pieces that go on the gunwales. They were removed at one point for refinishing and are in excellent condition.  There is also a near perfect replacement windshield frame that only needs a little finishing work.  The windshield on the boat already is original and in pretty good shape.  The replacement was on another Thompson I had that got scrapped. The motor on the boat was hung there and never rigged.  I have original controls for BOTH Mercury's.  Hanging both motors on this boat would look great! I had them both running, one needs a starter which I have. The lower unit needs put back on one of them, which I have. Both have two bladed props. Take a look at the pics and see what you think. This project is mostly a cosmetic project and motor rig. I have several pics if you need more. Boat is located in Ballard. I have titles for boat and trailer. No tabs for either. **EDIT** The second motor is no longer available as I've sold the powerhead. I do have an Evinrude 48 spl(for sale separately) that you can HAVE for free instead of the remaining Merc 500. I've never run the Evinrude but it's all there and I see no reason why it wouldn't run.

It has an awesome fire hose bumper on one side and 3 solid cleats. It has ulta heavy duty metal brackets as the builder, a long time resident of the lake, was a master welder. I just replaced a couple of trim pieces. There are a couple of rub marks in the wood below the waterline but nothing that affects the function or flotation. It floats straight and true and takes the Lake Wenatchee waves in stride! I will tow it to any location on the lake for you.
