Comes with TWO 1966 Mercury 50hp outboards. You can use one and keep the other as a backup or use them both as twins. I had them both running early in the summer but elected to use another outboard for my other boat they were on. The Thompson is in good shape and needs a little work to be water ready. The bilge was painted with the modern equivalent of ""red lead"" to discourage any rot/fungus in that area. The floors are temporarily installed along with the seats. There are side panels(which you hardly ever see with Thompson's) and ""kick"" panels that can be used as patterns or used as is(they're in ok shape). These panels are just leaning against the side in the pics to give an idea how they go/look. Not pictured are various teak trim pieces that go on the gunwales. They were removed at one point for refinishing and are in excellent condition. There is also a near perfect replacement windshield frame that only needs a little finishing work. The windshield on the boat already is original and in pretty good shape. The replacement was on another Thompson I had that got scrapped. The motor on the boat was hung there and never rigged. I have original controls for BOTH Mercury's. Hanging both motors on this boat would look great! I had them both running, one needs a starter which I have. The lower unit needs put back on one of them, which I have. Both have two bladed props. Take a look at the pics and see what you think. This project is mostly a cosmetic project and motor rig.
