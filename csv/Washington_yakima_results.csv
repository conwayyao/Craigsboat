Did some fiberglass work on the chines but haven't got around to sanding or gell coating everything. The bottom needs gell coat too. There is a small crack near the oar lock on the right that should be fixed. It doesn't go into the inside of the boat (see pic).  No dents just scratches from sitting up against rocks. Needs a little love but totally functional and can drift as is. It hasn't had any major repairs just your normal chine work and gell coat from normal use. It's been this way for awhile just hard to find time. Inside has been refinished along with the benches with skid-no-more, pretty close rhino liner but for boats.
