66,,[],2016-12-15 22:31,"Are you paying more than $64 per month to keep your boat in a regular land-locked storage unit?  Does keeping your boat in your garage prevent you from using your boat as much as you would like? Keep your boat in the most convenient and accessible marina in the area, and be on the water in minutes, without the hassle of trailering, boat ramps, and distant parking.  A private stall for a boat 20' or less is less than $64 per month ($760 per year)!  Perfect for fishing boats! A unique marina offering 24-7 access to your boat and the Fox River, with your VERY OWN locked storage unit (unit dimension is a large 10'x24'x10').  No need to call ahead when you want to go out: just unlock your personal storage unit, roll your boat (on our provided dolly) to one of our two hoists, and you're on the water!  Private. Simple. Convenient. Easy. Secure. Very affordable (less than the competition's common warehouse storage and even many mini-warehouse units!).  Visit our website at KubastasLanding.com If you are looking for just SUMMER STORAGE, we can do that, too.  Current winter storage leases end on April 31 (but sometimes are available before then).  Call early to make an appointment to visit, as space is limited. On the Fox River midway between Lake Winnebago, and Lake Butte des Morts... the center of Oshkosh between UW-Oshkosh and Titan Stadium.  Great central location to all the activity in the area. Our quaint marina has only 100 individually rented storage units.  Each unit fits up to a 22 ft. boat (overall length) and 3200 lbs. max weight .  You are provided your own key for your personal and secure unit.  Launch and return at any time of day or night.  Store your boating accessories in your secure unit (no more ""missing"" fishing gear, fuel, skis, life jackets, etc.!).  You have access to your unit and its contents 24/7/365 (unless snow and ice prevent sliding the unit door). We offer year-round out-of-water storage of up to 22' boats.  While the owners' residence is conveniently located just next door, you have complete access to your boat, boathouse unit, our 2 hoists, and the water--no need to make an appointment to access your boat or the water.  Have your boat in the water within minutes, even if you are by yourself.  Each boathouse unit has electricity and plenty of room to securely store all your gear and equipment--no need to haul everything back and forth from home, or worry about ""missing"" gear. Our marina, in a quaint, rustic, and private setting, has clean bathrooms, and a hose to rinse/wash your boat.  Simple, convenient, and unique.  Drive right up to your unit or boat to unload your gear, then park in our ample parking lot with plenty of shade. Contact John Kubasta by phone @ 920-235- Nine 6 7 eight or visit KubastasLanding.com or come see us at 400 N. Campbell Rd. Oshkosh.
