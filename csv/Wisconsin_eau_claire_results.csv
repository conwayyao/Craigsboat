If you ask a bunch of questions clearly explained in it, I'll ignore it and won't respond. The propeller ""popped"" off last winter from water inside which froze. I have a different lower for it and some parts will need to be swapped out between the two. I haven't ran the power head since early spring and my battery is totally shot, so I borrowed one to test it. It started ok, ran ok on muffs. May need fine tuning. The motor is a mid 70's mercury thunderbolt, 50hp. I replaced the main floor with treated plywood. I did roughly half of the carpeting already and have enough for it to be finished. It is marine grade carpet. I think this is a 1986, but don't recall for certain. I can look it up. It's a Lakeland 1578. The trailer is also a Lakeland. The trailer has surface rust, but is definitely a nice, heavy duty boat trailer. This would make a great boat for fishing or tubing. The design should make it super stable in the water.

It will look like new when it's on the water; but costs a lot less than new ones like this cost nowadays! We put all New Pontoon Furniture on it, including a New Steering Consul, New Captain's Chair, New L-shaped Sofa in the back, 2 New Bench Seats up front and 2 New Swivel Fish Seats on the front deck. It can comfortably seat 10-12 People; but officially has a US Coast Guard Maximum Seating Capacity of 14 Persons. It has a good solid deck made with 3/4 inch Marine Grade Plywood with New Heavy Duty Marine Vinyl. The Vinyl Flooring dries much quicker than carpet does, is a lot easier to clean and maintain than carpet, and doesn't get moldy like carpet so easily does. We also put a Brand New Heavy Duty Bimini Top on it. There is a little round table by the L-shaped Sofa (not shown in all of the photos.) It has a new Depth Finder/Fish Locator that had not been installed when I took these photos. The railing are in excellent condition. It has 4 entry gates, including a rear entry with a strong and sturdy built on swim ladder. This boat has the large diameter pontoons that can carry more people, plane out quicker and float higher so water won't come over the deck, even on windy days. Both pontoons are in very good condition. We pressure tested them and they do not have any leaks. This pontoon boat was on a lake and in use all last summer and fall. It was driven across a lake and onto a trailer late this fall. It has a 2004 50 HP JOHNSON 4-Stroke Motor with Electronic Fuel Injection and Power Trim and Tilt that is in excellent condition. I had it checked out, cleaned up and tuned up by a very good marine mechanic since we refurbished it and he said it started right up and ran really well. It runs very smooth and clean and quiet, and it won't burn too much gas! We could start it up for you; but it was winterized. It comes with a new extra large 12 gallon gas tank and a new battery so it's all ready to use in the spring. The title is clear without any liens on it. Please Note: You can buy this pontoon boat and motor for $12,000 without a trailer or for $13,500 with a new dual axle bunk pontoon trailer. If you buy it now, I can store it for the winter in my shop or deliver it anywhere in Minnesota for free. It is located in my shop in the small town of Remer in north central Minnesota, which is 250 miles from Eau Claire, 160 miles north of Minneapolis, 100 miles west of Duluth, 190 miles from Rice Lake, 300 miles from Wausau and 400 miles from Madison. You can look at it anytime, even in the evenings or on weekends, if I know when to meet you there. Thank you for considering my pontoon boats and I hope to talk with you sometime soon. Call or Text JIM ANYTIME (including evenings and weekends) on my cell phone at: show contact info if you have any questions or concerns whatsoever or if you want to see or buy a nicely refurbished pontoon boat.

It had a new marine grade plywood deck put on it with new carpet at that time along with a new steering consul and all new high quality furniture with a lot of cup holders. The boat lights and stereo were completely rewired and it had a new Stereo installed in it. It has a comfortable L-shaped Sofa in the back with a Recliner on one side, a very good Captain's Chair and 2 good Swiveling Fish Seats up front. All of the furniture is in excellent condition without any cuts, tears, holes, cracks or fading. It can comfortably seat 7 to 9 people depending on their age, size and weight. There is storage space inside all the bench seats. It has a good live well in the middle. I ordered a new heavy duty Bimini Top for it that is not pictured in these photos because it was back ordered. The railing is in good condition. It has the lower fishing railing which makes it easier to lift fish over the railing or to lean over it to net any big fish. This boat was originally manufactured in 1987 as was the trailer. The pontoons are still in very good condition. We pressure tested both of them and they do not have any leaks. It was in use all summer long and was driven onto the bunk trailer it is pictured on this fall. It comes with a used 2000 Oil Injected YAMAHA 90 HP 2-Stroke Motor that is in excellent condition. It has power trim and tilt and a long shaft, which is ideal for pontoon boats. I was told by the previous owner that it can easily pull kids of any age and weight on tubes and can even pull water skiers! I put it in a local lake in late October and it started right up and ran great. We could start it up for you; but it's been winterized.

I can have it shrink wrapped and/or store it for the winter or deliver it anywhere within 300 miles for free if you buy it this winter. If you are looking at pontoon boats at this time of the year, you must know this is the best time of the year to buy one; but the worst time of the year to sell them. That is why you can save $1000 from what I can sell it for in the spring... if you buy it now. You can look at it anytime, even in the evenings or on weekends, if I know when to meet you there.
