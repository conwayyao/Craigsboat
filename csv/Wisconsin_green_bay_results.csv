This boat has always been well cared for by both owners and is in excellent condition with only 307 hours on her MerCruiser 5.0 MPI engine and Bravo 3 duo prop drive.  It is a MN & WI fresh water only boat.  The reason for selling is we are purchasing a larger boat.  This boat has always had proper annual maintenance on her engine, stern drive, water heater and water system.  It has also always been kept in covered storage during the winter months and is available to be seen.  Winter storage is provided free to the purchaser for this winter season ending in June 2017.  Also included in the purchase price is the aluminum I-Beam tandem axel trailer. This Sundancer is equipped with an aft cabin that sleeps two and a convertible dinette that also sleeps two.  The galley includes a single burner stove, sink and refrigerator.  The cabin also includes a head with pump-out toilet, a sink and shower.  The cockpit area is well designed, easily accommodates guests and can be completely enclosed with the camper canvass and isinglass or use the Bimini tops to enjoy the summer breeze.  A mooring cover also covers the boat when trailering or at the dock.  Canvass and isinglass are in excellent condition.  Please note the picture of the head indicates the top half of the toilet is missing and that's because it is stored in a heated basement rather than on the boat during winter.  Also, the helm is missing the VHF radio because that too is stored at our home in a warm climate. This boat is priced below market value only because we prefer to not be the owners of two cabin cruiser boats and we hope it will be a quick sale!
