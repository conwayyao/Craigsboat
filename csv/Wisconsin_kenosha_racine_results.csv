I got the boat last year on a trade and loved every moment with it. As did the rest of my family.  While i would love to keep her and like we did last year take her out every weekend it's just not in the cards for me right now. So i thought i'd put it here and see what happens. I did set the price a bit low from the NADA guide suggested price cause there are 3 relative issues that i understand affect such things. Those are.... 1.) She is still in winter storage with a $975 balance to put her back in the water and would need a slip. 2.) The port starter has a dead spot. So while it can be rotated and made to work it could use to be replaced or at least rebuilt 3.) The previous owner took apart the fresh water system for whatever reason... He said it was all there and just needed to be put back together and it looked like it was there but i always just brought water out with me to use for me and the kids and never worried about it. I did start cleaning it up last year and did even add 4 large solar panels to the front and a setup of 8 batteries that are tied to the bilge system but i put a sort of fuse panel on it with additional spots the plan had been to move the fridge and radio and lighting to those so i could leave the house batteries (which i did add 2 and replaced one bad one) purely for starting and running. Like i said we used it nearly every weekend right up until the end of October. Just dont have the time or cash or motivation for it right now and with health issues is kinda been put on the back burner. So i will entertain any reasonable offer. Like i said i have already come down quite a bit from what NADA suggested. Will also consider trades or partial trades for things like a camper, atv(s), or smaller boat and wave-runner, or just about anything my kids could enjoy that can be a little easier for me to manage. Again thank you for looking and since i guess i must note this no i'm not looking for help selling and will not ship it to your 3rd world country.

In 2000 the Regal 4160 was the Flagship of the Regal fleet (later called the 4260, then the 4460). But by any designation the Regal was a high-style luxury sport yacht with a spacious, well-arranged interior and a particularly innovative cockpit layout. The 2000 Regal 4160  rides on a wide-beam deep-V hull with propeller pockets. The 4160's aggressive profile owes much to a gracefully integrated bow pulpit and a unique fore-and-aft arch design. Boarding from one of two transom gates, one is struck by the cockpit configuration,  the elevated bridge deck is huge with a large U-shaped settee and table opposite the helm. This arrangement creates a very social layout since most of the guest seating is centered near the double-wide helm seat rather than aft as is the case on most express cruisers. Lots of room on deck. Easily accommodates 10 adults. The 4160's plush two-stateroom interior features cabins with pocket doors for privacy (rather than curtains). Each cabin has it's own head and shower. Additional features include a walk-through windshield, cockpit wet bar, a power-assist windshield vent, foredeck sun pad, large transom storage locker, two refrigerators, ice maker, 2 burner stove, microwave, brand new JVC Bluetooth stereo with Subwoofer/Amp with Bose speakers. Transom shower. Windlass anchor. All interior and exterior replaced with LED bulbs for no heat and little power draw. Stainless davit that mounts to rear platform to lift wave runners/Jetski/dingy.

95,,,2016-11-20 11:48,"My grandfather passed this boat onto me about 6 years ago. He was the 2nd owner, and had bought it from the original owner in the late 60s. It has twin 35hp Gale Sovereign engines, which are highly sought after. He said it runs great and the engines would only need a basic tune-up. The boat has always been garage stored. The boat was mint green in color, so I repainted the interior a tan color, stripped the top down to the bare wood and began refinishing. I've primed and began painting the sides red. The bottom is a black fiberglass. I also had new tires and bearings put on the trailer. I have all original parts, and it also has a leather canopy that attaches behind the windshield.",,5885154147,,16,,Chris Craft,,,$5000,power," (Naperville, IL)",1960 Chris Craft kit boat 16',https://racine.craigslist.org/boa/5885154147.html,1960

All handles have been professionally welded on as well as a small patch on the bottom of the hull by Welding by K&K in Waukegan. There are no rips or holes in the boat, so therefore it does not leak at all. The trailer is not the same length of the boat, but has always worked just fine. The trailer tires have good tread and the spare is brand new. I have pulled it 5 hours up north many times and I have never had an issue with it. The engine is a 1978 Evinrude 9.9hp. I am the second owner of this engine and I purchased it off of my best friends uncle who took immaculate care of it! It has always been either garage kept or basement kept when not in use. It has under 40 original hours on it, and as you can tell by the photos it has been very well taken care of. I also have all the original paperwork and manuals that came with it! It has pushed the boat with myself and two other buddies in it with full duck hunting gear with ease! I will also throw in 2 plastic gas cans. For an extra fee I will throw in a brand new 30lb thrust Minn kota trolling motor if interested. I am willing to negotiate on the price, but I am not going to give it away.
