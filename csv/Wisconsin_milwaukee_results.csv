Their lightest, most portable kayak is America's most popular, the versatile Sea Eagle 330. It weighs just 26 lbs. and packs down small enough to fit in the smallest car trunk. Don't let the light weight fool you, it's a rugged kayak able to hold 2 people or 500 lbs and yet easy enough to be carried and paddled by one. Today, they offer superior one way valves, thicker hull material and an even better material formulation for greater strength, reliability, and durability on the water.

It's constructed with marine grade mahogany plywood and epoxy fiberglass.
