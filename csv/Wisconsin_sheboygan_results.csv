82,good,"['44.084934', '-87.677593']",2016-11-10 09:09,I'm looking to sell a canoe that I bought about a year ago from a coworker. I will be moving down to Virginia late November and don't want to drag it down with me if I don't have to. The canoe was made in 1981 and is in great shape. It is light enough for one person to lift but has hand holds for two people on bow and stern of the boat. I am willing to throw in a handmade (by me) hardwood paddle and three other paddles that came with it. I will also throw in an anchor that has a 20ft line attached. Feel free to email me with any other questions. I am firm on the price as I know this boat and paddle are worth more then this amount.,0,5869785411,44.084934,17,-87.677593,Osagian,"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@44.084934,-87.677593,16z",Classic Canoe,$400,human, (Manitowoc),17' Osagian Aluminum Canoe,https://sheboygan.craigslist.org/boa/5869785411.html,1981
