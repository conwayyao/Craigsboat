The upholstery is incredible! Sting Ray really out-did themselves for the Anniversary Edition. Comes with Tennessee custom 2005 trailer. We looked at 2009 Stingray's and the upholstery was not nearly as nice as what they put in this boat. We purchased it from an elderly gentleman who had put on less than 15 hours in 2009. In the last 7 summers we have put on about 12 hours yearly. Currently has about 120 hours, but my wife would prefer a deck or pontoon boat and thinks this boat is too fast (goes about 57 mph). This boat has been professionally winterize, never needed any repairs, carpet shampooed and detailed yearly. This is like a brand new boat mechanically and interior and is really awesome. Button on back deck to raise/lower prop. Merccruiser 4.3 liter, keel guard installed. Injection molded helm seats with fore and aft adjustor. Well cushioned bench, over sized drink holders, roomy contour bow with step that is also an integrated cooler.
